# Deploying AD DS in a New Organization
Thoroughly preparing your Active Directory Domain Services \(AD DS\) design is essential to a cost\-effective deployment. If your network environment is currently operating without a directory service, complete a comprehensive design of your AD DS logical structure before you deploy AD DS. Then, you can deploy a new forest root domain and deploy the rest of your domain structure according to your design.  
  
The following illustration shows the steps for deploying [!INCLUDE[nextref_longhorn](includes/nextref_longhorn_md.md)] AD DS in a network environment that is currently operating without a directory service.

For a list of detailed tasks that you can use to plan and deploy AD DS in a new organization, see [Checklist: Deploying AD DS in a New Organization](Checklist--Deploying-AD-DS-in-a-New-Organization.md).
