# BranchCache Network Shell and Windows PowerShell Commands
In Windows ServerÂ® 2016 Technical Preview, you can configure and manage BranchCache by using either Windows PowerShell or the Network Shell (Netsh) commands for BranchCache.  
  
In future versions of Windows, Microsoft might remove the netsh functionality for BranchCache. Microsoft recommends that you transition to Windows PowerShell if you currently use netsh to configure and manage BranchCache and other networking technologies.  
  
Windows PowerShell and netsh command references are at the following locations. Although both command references were published for operating systems earlier than Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview, these references are accurate for this operating system.

> [!TIP]  
> To view a list of Windows PowerShell commands for BranchCache at the Windows PowerShell prompt, type `Get-Command -Module BranchCache` at the Windows PowerShell prompt, and then press ENTER.
