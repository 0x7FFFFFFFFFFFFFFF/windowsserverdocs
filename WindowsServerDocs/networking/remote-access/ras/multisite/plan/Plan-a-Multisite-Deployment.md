# Plan a Multisite Deployment

>Applies To: Windows Server Technical Preview

Windows Server® 2016 Technical Preview, Windows Server® 2012 combine DirectAccess and Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) VPN into a single Remote Access role. This overview provides an introduction to the planning steps required in order to deploy Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview or  Windows Server 2012  Remote Access in a multisite configuration.  
  
1.  [Step 1: Plan a single server Remote Access deployment](assetId:///d85aa8a8-ef06-4021-a4ea-38de816f19cd)—This step includes planning for the infrastructure required to deploy a single server. It includes planning for network and server settings, certificate requirements, DNS settings, network location server deployment, DirectAccess management servers, Active Directory settings, and Group Policy objects (GPOs).  
  
2.  [Step 2: Plan the multisite infrastructure](assetId:///bd7b4f5e-91b5-49ac-81bb-53c0008b7f4f)—This step includes Active Directory and GPO planning, and DNS configuration.  
  
3.  [Step 3: Plan multisite entry points](assetId:///19d49dbf-1786-47bb-ab97-f0458c53d91d)—This step includes planning certificate settings, network location server configuration, client entry point settings, IPv6 prefix settings, and optionally global load balancing settings.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Record your planning decisions for Remote Access advanced deployment. This record can be used as a job aid for everyone involved in completing the deployment steps.  
  
After you have completed these planning steps, see [Configuring a multisite deployment](assetId:///68492f3d-772e-4e68-a0ae-572be4e7d35f). For instructions on configuring a multisite deployment as a proof of concept in a lab environment, see [Test Lab Guide: Demonstrate a DirectAccess multisite deployment](assetId:///3f2308e3-aa31-49db-b69b-91d1827ef7a2).
