# Step 1 Implement a Single Server Remote Access Deployment

>Applies To: Windows Server Technical Preview

The first configuration step to deploy Remote Access with OTP is to implement an advanced single server deployment and then plan to add the RADIUS server.  
  
## Implement a single server deployment  
Before you can configure Remote Access with OTP, you must configure an advanced single server Remote Access deployment as described in [Deploy a single Remote Access server with advanced settings](assetId:///3475e527-541f-4a34-b940-18d481ac59f6).
