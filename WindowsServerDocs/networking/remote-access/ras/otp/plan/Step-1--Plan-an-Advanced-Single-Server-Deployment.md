# Step 1 Plan an Advanced Single Server Deployment

>Applies To: Windows Server Technical Preview

The first step in planning a Remote Access with one-time password (OTP) client authentication deployment is to plan and configure an advanced single server deployment.  
  
## Plan a single server deployment  
Before you deploy Remote Access with OTP, make sure that you have completed all the steps to deploy a single Remote Access server. See [Deploy a single Remote Access server with advanced settings](assetId:///3475e527-541f-4a34-b940-18d481ac59f6). Then continue to [Step 2: Plan the RADIUS server deployment](assetId:///913954de-8be6-4fb8-82f5-fa9c0944a959).
