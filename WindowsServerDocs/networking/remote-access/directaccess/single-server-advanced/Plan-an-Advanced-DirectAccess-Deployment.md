This topic lists the planning steps that are required to deploy a single DirectAccess server running Windows Server&reg; 2016 Technical Preview, Windows Server&reg; 2012 R2, or Windows Server&reg; 2012 with a full range of basic and advanced features. The planning phase includes the following topics.  
  
-   [Step 1: Plan the DirectAccess Infrastructure](Step-1--Plan-the-DirectAccess-Infrastructure.md)

-   [Step 2: Plan DirectAccess Deployments](Step-2--Plan-DirectAccess-Deployments.md)  
  
    In this phase, you plan for the client and server deployment, including the DirectAccess infrastructure and the application servers.  
  
## Next step  
After you have completed these planning steps, you can begin the server deployment. For instructions, see [Install and Configure Advanced DirectAccess](Install-and-Configure-Advanced-DirectAccess.md).
