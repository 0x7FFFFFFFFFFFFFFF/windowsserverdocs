# Scopes and IP address range planning in DHCP server

A DHCP scope is an administrative grouping of IP addresses for computers on a subnet that that the DHCP server can lease to clients. When you define one or more scopes on your DHCP server, the server can manage the distribution and assignment of IP addresses to DHCP clients.

Scopes enable you to configure network settings for all clients, such as DNS servers and network gateways. Scopes filter hosts by name, MAC address, and even operating system before assigning an IP address. You can configure policy for each scope.

The DHCP server administrator first creates a scope for each physical subnet and then uses the scope to define the parameters and policies that clients must follow.

## Scope properties

A DHCP scope has the following properties:

- A range of IP addresses from which to include or exclude addresses used for DHCP service lease offerings.

- A subnet mask, which determines the subnet prefix for a given IP address.

- A scope name assigned when it is created.

- Lease duration values, which are assigned to DHCP clients that receive dynamically allocated IP addresses.

- Any DHCP scope options configured for assignment to DHCP clients, such as DNS server IP address and router/default gateway IP address.

- Reservations are optionally used to ensure that a DHCP client always receives the same IP address.

Before deploying your servers, list your subnets and the IP address range you want to use for each subnet.

## Types of scopes

In addition to a single DHCP scope configured with a standard distribution of IP addresses, other types of scopes available in an authorized IPv4 DHCP server can provide expanded functionality, depending on your user requirements and deployment considerations.

### Single scope

A single scope is the simplest configuration possible in DHCP. A single scope is a range of IP addresses and associated configuration options allocated to DHCP clients in a specific subnet.

### Multicast scope

Multicasting in Windows is the process of sending a message to a group of recipients, in contrast to a message that's sent to a specific recipient. In a single scope setup, DHCP assigns each DHCP client a single unique IP address from a range of IP addresses that you planned and configured prior to activating the scope. A multicast scope is a group of IP multicast network addresses that can be distributed by the DHCP server to other computers in your network using the Multicast Address Dynamic Client Allocation Protocol (MADCAP).  MADCAP controls how the DHCP servers dynamically assign IP addresses on a TCP/IP network. Multicast scopes enable you to configure a scope so that messages assigned to a multicast IP address are sent to all clients in a Windows multicast group. See [RFC2730](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2730) for more information on MADCAP.

### DHCP Superscope

DHCP Superscope is an administrative feature of DHCP server that you can use to group multiple scopes as a single administrative entity. Identifying which scopes go with which networks can be a difficult administrative task. In an environment with multiple subnets defined on a single physical network, superscopes enable your DHCP server to assign leases to clients across those multiple subnets. See [DHCP Superscopes](../openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-dhcpm/4b3dafe4-70e5-4085-969e-4bb402d9c68b) to learn more about how to enable DHCP superscope.

## Scope options

Scope options configured at the server level will be applied to all DHCP clients regardless of which subnet they are on. Functionality that you want to be present across all DHCP clients should be configured at the server level. These standard options include:

- Default gateway
- Domain Name and DNS servers
- WINS servers

### Specific vendor-class options

- Extra Msft options?
- Custom configurations (including defining user classes)?

## Defining a DHCP scope

Each subnet can have only a single DHCP scope with a single continuous range of IP addresses. To use several address ranges within a single scope or subnet for DHCP service, you must first define the scope and then set any required exclusion ranges. The following section of this article provides guidance on planning for exclusion ranges.

## Planning address ranges

Planning IP address ranges across multiple scopes on an authorized IPv4 DHCP server is central to understanding how scopes work and successfully creating new scopes. 

IP address ranges must be planned prior to setting up scopes. See [Install DHCP Server](quickstart-install-configure-DHCP-server.md) for guidance on creating a new scope on an authorized DHCP IPv4 server.

address pools (see planning IP addreses) 
address leases (similar to superscopes -- these are the active leases currently in use)
reservations (the exclusions ... two methods 1. plan it with range so it doesn't include static IP or; use this method -- exclusions)

## Creating IP address ranges

Each subnet must have its own unique IP address range. The IP address range specifices which IP addresses to include or exclude for assignment to DHCP clients. In other words, you can select a range of IP addresses that can be used by devices connected to your DHCP service. These IP address ranges are represented on a DHCP server with scopes or groupings of IP addresses on the subnet that uses the DHCP service. 

You also can exclude specific IP addresses that you do not want clients to use. 

### Defining IP address range

When you define your IP address range for each scope use the full range of consecutive IP addresses that make up the local subnet of your DHCP service. As a best practice, you want to establish the entire range of addresses before identifying the static IPs within your range. You then can identify which of the remaining IPs are available for DHCP clients to lease.

### Static IP addresses

Your network includes servers, routers, switches, printers, and other devices that may require static IP addresses. Make a list of these devices while adding additional placeholder addresses for use as your needs expand.

Before you begin recording static IP addresses, be sure to record the routerâ€™s IP address. This is the default gateway value. A best practice is to choose either the first or the last address in the static IP address range.

If there are any IP addresses you wish to prevent clients from using, make a list of these also so that you optionally can enter them manually later in the DHCP server Management Console as part of creating a new DHCP scope. See []() for more information on configuring DHCP server new scope settings. Otherwise, you can establish the range of static IPs, including unused addresses to retain as your network inevitably grows.

### Exclusion ranges

It might become necessary to manually configure some servers and other devices with static IP addresses from the same IP address range that the DHCP server is using. When you manually configure some servers and other devices with static IP addresses from the same IP address range that the DHCP server is using, it is possible to unintentionally create an IP address conflict in which you and the DHCP server both assign the same IP address to different devices.

To solve this problem, you can create an exclusion range for the DHCP scope. An exclusion range is a contiguous range of IP addresses within the scope's IP address range that the DHCP server is not allowed to use. If you create an exclusion range, the DHCP server won't assign the addresses in that range, allowing you to manually assign these addresses without creating an IP address conflict.

You should use exclusions for all devices that are configured with a static IP address. The excluded addresses should include all IP addresses that you assigned manually to other servers, non-DHCP clients, diskless workstations, or Routing and Remote Access and PPP clients. A simple spreadsheet can assist you in keeping track of your addresses and the purpose of each. 

It is recommended that you configure your exclusion range with extra addresses to accommodate future network growth. The following table provides an example exclusion range for a scope with an IP address range of 10.0.0.1 - 10.0.0.254 and a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0.

|Configuration items|Example values|
|-----------------------|------------------|
|Exclusion range Start IP Address|10.0.0.1|
|Exclusion range End IP Address|10.0.0.25|
