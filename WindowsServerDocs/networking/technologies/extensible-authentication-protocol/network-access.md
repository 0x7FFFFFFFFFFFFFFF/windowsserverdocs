# Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) for network access

> Applies to: Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows 11, Windows 10, Windows 8.1

The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is an authentication framework that allows for the use of different authentication methods for secure network access technologies. Examples of these technologies include wireless access using IEEE 802.1X, wired access using IEEE 802.1X, and Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) connections like Virtual Private Networking (VPN). EAP isn't a specific authentication method like MS-CHAP v2, but rather a framework that enables networking vendors to develop and install new authentication methods, known as EAP methods, on the access client and authentication server. The EAP framework is originally defined by [RFC 3748](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3748.txt) and extended by various other RFCs and standards.

## Authentication methods

EAP authentication methods that are used within tunneled EAP methods are commonly known as **inner methods** or **EAP types**. Methods that are set up as **inner methods** have the same configuration settings as they would when used as an outer method. This article contains configuration information specific to the following authentication methods in EAP.

**EAP-Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS)**: [Standards-based](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5216) EAP method that uses TLS with certificates for mutual authentication. Appears as **Smart Card or other Certificate (EAP-TLS)** in Windows. EAP-TLS can be deployed as an **inner method** for another EAP method or as a standalone EAP method.
> [!TIP]
> EAP methods that use EAP-TLS, being certificate-based, generally offer the highest level of security. For example, EAP-TLS is the only allowed EAP method for WPA3-Enterprise 192-bit mode.

**EAP-Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol version 2 (EAP-MSCHAP v2)**: [Microsoft-defined](/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-chap) EAP method that encapsulates the [MSCHAP v2 authentication protocol](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2759.txt), which uses username and password, for authentication. Appears as **Secure password (EAP-MSCHAP v2)** in Windows. EAP-MSCHAPv2 can be used as a standalone method for VPN, but only as an **inner method** for wired/wireless.
> [!WARNING]
> MSCHAPv2-based connections are subject to similar attacks as for NTLMv1. Windows 11 Enterprise, version 22H2 (build 22621) enables [Windows Defender Credential Guard](/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard-considerations#wi-fi-and-vpn-considerations) which may cause issues with MSCHAPv2-based connections.

**Protected EAP (PEAP)**: [Microsoft-defined](/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-peap) EAP method that encapsulates EAP within a TLS tunnel. The TLS tunnel secures the inner EAP method, which could be unprotected otherwise. Windows supports EAP-TLS and EAP-MSCHAP v2 as inner methods.

**EAP-Tunneled Transport Layer Security (EAP-TTLS)**: Described by [RFC 5281](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5281), encapsulates a TLS session that performs mutual authentication using another inner authentication mechanism. This inner method can be either an EAP protocol, such as EAP-MSCHAP v2, or a non-EAP protocol, such as Password Authentication Protocol (PAP). In Windows Server 2012, the inclusion of EAP-TTLS only provides support on the client-side (in Windows 8). NPS doesn't support EAP-TTLS at this time. The client support enables interoperation with commonly deployed RADIUS servers that support EAP-TTLS.

**EAP-Subscriber Identity Module (EAP-SIM), EAP-Authentication and Key Agreement (EAP-AKA), and EAP-AKA Prime (EAP-AKA')**: Described by various RFCs, enables authentication by using SIM cards, and is implemented when a customer purchases a wireless broadband service plan from a mobile network operator. As part of the plan, the customer commonly receives a wireless profile that is preconfigured for SIM authentication.

**Tunnel EAP (TEAP)**: Described by [RFC 7170](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7170), tunneled EAP method that establishes a secure TLS tunnel and executes other EAP methods inside that tunnel. Supports EAP chaining - authenticating the machine and user within one authentication session. In Windows Server 2022, the inclusion of TEAP only provides support for the client-side - Windows 10, version 2004 (build 19041). NPS doesn't support TEAP at this time. The client support enables interoperation with commonly deployed RADIUS servers that support TEAP. Windows supports EAP-TLS and EAP-MSCHAP v2 as inner methods.

## Configuring EAP properties

You can access the EAP properties for 802.1X authenticated wired and wireless access in the following ways:

- Configuring the Wired Network (IEEE 802.3) Policies and Wireless Network (IEEE 802.11) Policies extensions in Group Policy.
  - Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings
- Using Mobile Device Management (MDM) software, such as Intune ([Wi-Fi](/mem/intune/configuration/wi-fi-settings-windows)/[Wired](/mem/intune/configuration/wired-network-settings-windows))
  - [Wi-Fi CSP](/windows/client-management/mdm/wifi-csp)
  - [WiredNetwork CSP](/windows/client-management/mdm/wirednetwork-csp)
- Manually configuring wired or wireless connections on client computers.

> [!NOTE]
> The various configuration GUIs do not always show every technically possible option. For example, Windows Server 2019 and earlier are unable to configure TEAP in UI. However, it is often possible to import an existing XML profile that has previously been configured.

You can access the EAP properties for virtual private network (VPN) connections in the following ways:

- Using Mobile Device Management (MDM) software, such as [Intune](/mem/intune/configuration/vpn-settings-windows-10)
  - [VPNv2 CSP](/windows/client-management/mdm/vpnv2-csp)
  - [VPN profile options](/windows/security/operating-system-security/network-security/vpn/vpn-profile-options)
- Manually configuring VPN connections on client computers.
- Using Connection Manager Administration Kit (CMAK) to configure VPN connections.

## XML profiles for EAP

The profiles used for different connections types are XML files that contain the configuration options for that connection. Each different connection type will follow a specific schema:

- [Wi-Fi profiles](/windows/win32/nativewifi/wlan-profileschema-elements)
- [Wired network profiles](/windows/win32/nativewifi/lan-profileschema-schema)
- [VPN profiles](/windows/client-management/mdm/vpnv2-csp#profilexml-xsd-schema)

However, when configured to use EAP, each profile schema has a child element [EapHostConfig](/windows/win32/eaphost/eaphostconfigschema-schema) element.

- Wired/Wireless: `EapHostConfig` is a child element of the [EAPConfig](/windows/win32/nativewifi/onexschema-eapconfig-onex-element) element. **MSM > security** ([Wired](/windows/win32/nativewifi/lan-profileschema-security-msm-element)/[Wireless](/windows/win32/nativewifi/wlan-profileschema-security-msm-element)) **>** [OneX](/windows/win32/nativewifi/onexschema-elements) **> EAPConfig**
- VPN: `EapHostConfig` is a child element of **NativeProfile > Authentication > Eap > Configuration**

This configuration syntax is defined in the [Group Policy: Wireless/Wired Protocol Extension](/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-gpwl) specification.

## Authentication method configuration settings

> [!CAUTION]
> If a Network Access Server is configured to allow the same type of authentication method for a tunneled EAP method (e.g. PEAP) and a non-tunneled EAP method (e.g. EAP-MSCHAP v2), there is a potential security vulnerability. When you deploy both a tunneled EAP method and EAP (which isn't protected), don't use the same authentication type. For example, if you deploy PEAP-TLS, do not also deploy EAP-TLS. This is because if you require the protection of the tunnel, it serves no purpose to permit the method to be executed outside of the tunnel as well.

The following table explains the configurable settings for each authentication method.

## [EAP-TLS](#tab/eap-tls)

The EAP-TLS settings in the UI map to [EapTlsConnectionPropertiesV1](/windows/win32/eaphost/eaptlsconnectionpropertiesv1schema-schema) which is extended by [EapTlsConnectionPropertiesV2](/windows/win32/eaphost/eaptlsconnectionpropertiesv2schema-schema) and [EapTlsConnectionPropertiesV3](/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-gpwl/65562521-4153-4e20-9c4a-612e190886ee).

|**Use a certificate on this computer**|Wired/Wireless: Enabled<p>VPN: Disabled|[CredentialsSource](/windows/win32/eaphost/eaptlsconnectionpropertiesv1schema-credentialssource-eaptype-element) **>** [CertificateStore](/windows/win32/eaphost/eaptlsconnectionpropertiesv1schema-certificatestore-credentialssourceparameters-element)|Specifies that authenticating clients must use a certificate located in the Current User or Local Computer certificate stores.|
|**Use simple certificate selection (Recommended)**|Wired/Wireless: Enabled<p>VPN: Disabled|[SimpleCertSelection](/windows/win32/eaphost/eaptlsconnectionpropertiesv1schema-simplecertselection-certselection-element)|Specifies whether Windows will automatically select a certificate for authentication without user interaction (if possible) or if Windows will show a dropdown for the user to select a certificate.|
|**Advanced**|||Opens the [Configure Certificate Selection](#cert-filteringinfo) dialog box.|
|**Verify the server’s identity by validating the certificate**|Enabled|[PerformServerValidation](/windows/win32/eaphost/eaptlsconnectionpropertiesv1schema-performservervalidation-peapextensionstype-element)|Specifies that the client verifies that the server certificates presented to the client computer have the correct signatures, haven't expired, and were issued by a trusted root certification authority (CA). Disabling this check box causes client computers to be unable to verify the identity of your servers during the authentication process. If server authentication doesn't occur, users are exposed to severe security risks, including the possibility that users might unknowingly connect to a rogue network.|
|**Connect to these servers**|Wired/Wireless: Disabled<p>VPN: Enabled|[ServerValidation](/windows/win32/eaphost/eaptlsconnectionpropertiesv1schema-servervalidation-eaptype-element) **>** [ServerNames](/windows/win32/eaphost/eaptlsconnectionpropertiesv1schema-servernames-servervalidationparameters-element)|Allows you to specify the name for Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) servers that provide network authentication and authorization.<p> You must type the name **exactly** as it appears in the **subject** field of each RADIUS server certificate or use regular expressions to specify the server name.<p> The complete syntax of the regular expression can be used to specify the server name, but to differentiate a regular expression with the literal string, you must use at least one `*` in the string specified. For example, you can specify `nps.*\.example\.com` to specify the RADIUS server `nps1.example.com` or `nps2.example.com`.<p> You can also include a `;` to separate multiple servers.<p> **If no RADIUS servers are specified, the client verifies that the RADIUS server certificate was issued by a trusted root CA.**|

The list is built from the trusted root CAs that are installed in the computer and in the user certificate stores. You can specify which trusted root CA certificates supplicants use to determine whether they trust your servers, such as your server running Network Policy Server (NPS) or your provisioning server. If no trusted root CAs are selected, the 802.1X client verifies that the computer certificate of the RADIUS server was issued by an installed trusted root CA. If one or multiple trusted root CAs are selected, the 802.1X client verifies that the computer certificate of the RADIUS server was issued by a selected trusted root CA. <p> **If no trusted root CAs are selected, the client verifies that the RADIUS server certificate was issued by a trusted root CA.** <p> If you have a public key infrastructure (PKI) on your network, and you use your CA to issue certificates to your RADIUS servers, your CA certificate is automatically added to the list of trusted root CAs. You can also purchase a CA certificate from a non-Microsoft vendor. Some non-Microsoft trusted root CAs provide software with your purchased certificate that automatically installs the purchased certificate into the **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** certificate store. In this case, the trusted root CA automatically appears in the list of trusted root CAs.<p> Don't specify a trusted root CA certificate that isn't already listed in client computers’ **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** certificate stores for **Current User** and **Local Computer**. If you designate a certificate that isn't installed on client computers, authentication will fail.<p> In XML, this is the SHA-1 thumbprint (hash) of the certificate.|

If the user accepts the certificate, authentication proceeds. If the user rejects the certificate, the connection attempt fails. With this option, if the root certificate isn't present on the computer, the user isn't notified and connection attempts fail.<p> 3. **Tell user if the server’s identity cannot be verified** - If the server name isn't in the **Connect to these servers** list, or the root certificate is found but isn't selected in the list of **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** in **PEAP Properties**, or the root certificate isn't found on the computer, then the user is prompted whether to accept the root certificate. If the user accepts the certificate, authentication proceeds. If the user rejects the certificate, connection attempts fail. |

|**Enable fast reconnect**|Enabled|[FastReconnect](/windows/win32/eaphost/mspeapconnectionpropertiesv1schema-fastreconnect-eaptype-element)|Enables the ability to create a new or refreshed security association more efficiently and with a smaller number of round-trips if a security association was previously established. For VPN connections, **fast reconnect** uses IKEv2 technology to provide seamless and consistent VPN connectivity when users temporarily lose their Internet connections. This feature is especially useful for users who connect via wireless mobile broadband as when an Internet connection drops, **fast reconnect** will automatically re-establish active VPN connections seamlessly and transparently to users. |
|**Disconnect if server does not present cryptobinding TLV**|Disabled|[RequireCryptoBinding](/windows/win32/eaphost/mspeapconnectionpropertiesv1schema-requirecryptobinding-eaptype-element)|Specifies that connecting clients must end the network authentication process if the RADIUS server doesn't present cryptobinding Type-Length-Value (TLV). Cryptobinding TLV is a security feature that enhances the security of the TLS tunnel in PEAP. It does this by combining the inner and outer method authentications, making it difficult for attackers to perform man-in-the-middle attacks by redirecting an MS-CHAP v2 authentication through the PEAP channel.|

## [TEAP](#tab/teap)

|Setting|Default|Description|
|--|--|--|
|**Identity privacy**|Enabled|Allows for different levels of privacy of the client's identity from the server during the authentication process using a generated temporary encryption key. You must type the name **exactly** as it appears in the **subject** field. The available options are:<ul><li>**anonymous** - Provides full anonymity where the client's identity is hidden from the server during the authentication process.<li>**pseudonymous** - Provides partial anonymity where the client's identity is partially hidden from the server, but some information, such as the client's domain or organization, may be visible.<li>**identified** - Provides no anonymity where the client's full identity is visible to the server during the authentication process.</ul></li>|
|**Connect to these servers**|Wired/Wireless: Disabled<p>VPN: Enabled|Allows you to specify the name for Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) servers that provide network authentication and authorization.<p> You must type the name **exactly** as it appears in the **subject** field of each RADIUS server certificate or use regular expressions to specify the server name.<p> The complete syntax of the regular expression can be used to specify the server name, but to differentiate a regular expression with the literal string, you must use at least one `*` in the string specified. For example, you can specify `nps.*\.example\.com` to specify the RADIUS server `nps1.example.com` or `nps2.example.com`.<p> You can also include a `;` to separate multiple servers.<p> **If no RADIUS servers are specified, the client verifies that the RADIUS server certificate was issued by a trusted root CA.**|
|**Trusted Root Certification Authorities**|No trusted root CAs are selected|Lists the trusted root certification authorities. The list is built from the trusted root CAs that are installed in the computer and in the user certificate stores. You can specify which trusted root CA certificates supplicants use to determine whether they trust your servers, such as your server running Network Policy Server (NPS) or your provisioning server. If no trusted root CAs are selected, the 802.1X client verifies that the computer certificate of the RADIUS server was issued by an installed trusted root CA. If one or multiple trusted root CAs are selected, the 802.1X client verifies that the computer certificate of the RADIUS server was issued by a selected trusted root CA. <p> **If no trusted root CAs are selected, the client verifies that the RADIUS server certificate was issued by a trusted root CA.** <p> If you have a public key infrastructure (PKI) on your network, and you use your CA to issue certificates to your RADIUS servers, your CA certificate is automatically added to the list of trusted root CAs. You can also purchase a CA certificate from a non-Microsoft vendor. Some non-Microsoft trusted root CAs provide software with your purchased certificate that automatically installs the purchased certificate into the **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** certificate store. In this case, the trusted root CA automatically appears in the list of trusted root CAs.<p> Don't specify a trusted root CA certificate that isn't already listed in client computers’ **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** certificate stores for **Current User** and **Local Computer**. If you designate a certificate that isn't installed on client computers, authentication will fail.|
|**Don't prompt user if unable to authorize server**|Disabled|Specifies, when not selected, that if server certificate validation fails due to any of the following reasons, the user is prompted to accept or reject the server:<ul><li><p> A root certificate for the server certificate isn't found or not selected in the **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** list.<li> One or more of the intermediate root certificates in the certificate chain isn't found.<li> The subject name in the server certificate doesn't match any of the servers that are specified in the **Connect to these servers** list. |
|**Select a primary EAP method for authentication**|None|Allows the user to choose a primary authentication method between **Microsoft: Smart card or other certificate (EAP-TLS)** and **Microsoft: Secured password (EAP-MSCHAP v2)**.<p> If **EAP-TLS** is selected as the primary and **EAP-MSCHAP v2** as the secondary, Windows attempts to authenticate using EAP-TLS first.<p> If EAP-TLS fails or isn't supported by the server, Windows will then attempt to authenticate using EAP-MSCHAP v2.|
|**Configure**|Disabled|If **Microsoft: Smart card or other certificate (EAP-TLS)** is selected, it opens the **Smart Card or other Certificate Properties** dialog box.<p> If **Microsoft: Secured password (EAP-MSCHAP v2)** is selected, the **Automatically use my Windows logon name and password (and domain if any)** checkbox becomes available, which specifies that the current user-based Windows sign-in name and password are used as network authentication credentials.|
|**Select a primary EAP method for authentication**|None|Allows the user to choose a secondary authentication method between **Microsoft: Smart card or other certificate (EAP-TLS)** and **Microsoft: Secured password (EAP-MSCHAP v2**).<p> If **EAP-MSCHAP v2** is selected as the primary and **EAP-TLS** as the secondary, Windows attempts to authenticate using EAP-MSCHAP v2 first.<p> If EAP-MSCHAP v2 fails or isn't supported by the server, Windows will then attempt to authenticate using EAP-TLS.|

## Cellular authentication configuration settings

The following lists the configuration settings for EAP-SIM, EPA-AKA, and EPA-AKA' respectively.

## [EAP-SIM](#tab/eap-sim)

EAP-SIM is defined in [RFC 4186](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4186). EAP Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) is used for authentication and session key distribution using the 2nd generation mobile network Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) Subscriber Identity Module (SIM).

| Item | Description |
|--|--|
| **Use strong Cipher keys** | Specifies that if selected, the profile uses strong encryption. |
| **Do not reveal real identity to server when pseudonym identity is available** | When enabled, forces the client to fail the authentication if server requests for permanent identity though the client have a pseudonym identity with it. Pseudonym identities are used for identity privacy so that the actual or permanent identity of a user isn't revealed during authentication. |
| **Enable usage of realms** | Provides a place to type the realm name. If this field is left blank with **Enable usage of realms** selected, the realm is derived from the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) using the realm 3gpp.org, as described in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standard 23.003 V6.8.0. |
| **Specify a realm** | Provides a place to type the realm name |

## [EAP-AKA](#tab/eap-aka1)

EAP-AKA is defined in [RFC 4187](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4187). EAP Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) is used for authentication and session key distribution by using the AKA mechanism. AKA is used in the 3rd generation mobile networks Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) and CDMA2000. AKA is based on symmetric keys and typically runs in a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM).

| Item | Description |
|--|--|
| **Do not reveal real identity to server when pseudonym identity is available** | When enabled, forces the client to fail the authentication if server requests for permanent identity though the client have a pseudonym identity with it. Pseudonym identities are used for identity privacy so that the actual or permanent identity of a user isn't revealed during authentication. |
| **Enable usage of realms** | Provides a place to type the realm name. If this field is left blank with **Enable usage of realms** selected, the realm is derived from the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) using the realm 3gpp.org, as described in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standard 23.003 V6.8.0. |
| **Specify a realm** | Provides a place to type the realm name. |

## [EAP-AKA'](#tab/eap-aka2)

EAP-AKA' is defined in [RFC 5448](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5448) and [RFC 9048](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9048). EAP-AKA Prime (AKA') is a modified version of EAP-AKA that adds a new key derivation function to facilitate access to the 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)-based networks by using non-3GPP standards, such as:

- Wi-Fi
- Evolution-Data Optimized (EVDO)
- Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMax)

| Item | Description |
|--|--|
| **Do not reveal real identity to server when pseudonym identity is available** | When enabled, forces the client to fail the authentication if server requests for permanent identity though the client have a pseudonym identity with it. Pseudonym identities are used for identity privacy so that the actual or permanent identity of a user isn't revealed during authentication. |
| **Enable usage of realms** | Provides a place to type the realm name. If this field is left blank with **Enable usage of realms** selected, the realm is derived from the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) using the realm 3gpp.org, as described in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standard 23.003 V6.8.0. |
| **Specify a realm** | Provides a place to type the realm name. |
| **Ignore network name mismatch** | The client compares the name of network known to it, with the name sent by the RADIUS server during authentication. If there's a mismatch, it's ignored if this option is selected. If not selected, authentication fails. |
| **Enable Fast Reauthentication** | Specifies that fast reauthentication is enabled. Fast Reauthentication is useful when SIM authentication happens frequently. The encryption keys that are derived from full authentication are reused. As a result, the SIM algorithm isn't required to run for every authentication attempt, and the number of network operations that result from frequent authentication attempts is reduced. |
