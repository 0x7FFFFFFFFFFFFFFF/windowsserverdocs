# Create a New NIC Team

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016

You can use this topic to create a new NIC Team on a host computer or in a Hyper-V virtual machine (VM) that is running  Windows Server 2016.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you are creating a new NIC Team in a VM, review the topic [Create a New NIC Team in a VM](../../technologies/nic-teaming/Create-a-New-NIC-Team-in-a-VM.md) before you perform this procedure.  
  
Membership in **Administrators**, or equivalent, is the minimum required to perform this procedure.  
  
### To create a new NIC Team  
  
1.  In Server Manager, click **Local Server**.  
  
2.  In the **Properties** pane, in the first column, locate **NIC Teaming**, and then click the link **Disabled** to the right. The **NIC Teaming** dialog box opens.

3.  In **Adapters and Interfaces**, select the network adapters that you want to add to a NIC Team. For example, if you want to add the adapters Ethernet 2 and Ethernet 3 to a new NIC Team, make the selection per the illustration below.

6.  In **Additional properties**, select values for **Teaming mode**, **Load balancing mode**, and **Standby adapter**. In most cases, the highest performing load balancing mode is **Dynamic**. For more detailed explanations of these modes, see the topic [Create a New NIC Team on a Host Computer or VM](../../technologies/nic-teaming/Create-a-New-NIC-Team-on-a-Host-Computer-or-VM.md).  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > If you are configuring a NIC Team in a virtual machine (VM), you must select a **Teaming mode** of **Switch Independent** and a **Load balancing mode** of **Address Hash**.
