# Virtual Private Networking (VPN)

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016

In Windows Server 2016, **DirectAccess and VPN** is a role service of the **Remote Access** server role.

When you install Remote Access as a VPN server, you can use Virtual Private Networking \(VPN\) to provide your remote employees with connections to your organization network across the Internet - while also maintaining information privacy with encrypted connections.

With Windows Server 2016 Remote Access VPN - and Windows 10 client computers - you can now deploy Always On VPN. Always On VPN gives you the ability to manage remote VPN clients that are always connected to your organization network, while also providing convenience for remote workers, who no longer need to manually start and stop VPN connections to your organization network.

For more information, see [Remote Access Always On VPN Deployment Guide for Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/remote/remote-access/vpn/always-on-vpn/deploy/always-on-vpn-deploy).

>[!NOTE]
>VPN documentation is now located in the [Remote access and server management](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/remote/) section of the Windows Server 2016 table of contents, under [Remote Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/remote/remote-access/remote-access).

For more information about VPN, see [Virtual Private Networking (VPN)](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/remote/remote-access/vpn/vpn-top).
