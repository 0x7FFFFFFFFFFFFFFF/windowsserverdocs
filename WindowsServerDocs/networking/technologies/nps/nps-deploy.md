The Windows Server 2016 Core Network Guide includes a section on planning and installing Network Policy Server \(NPS\), and the technologies presented in the guide serve as prerequisites for deploying NPS in an Active Directory domain. For more information, see the section "Deploy NPS1" in the Windows Server 2016 [Core Network Guide](https://technet.microsoft.com/windows-server-docs/networking/core-network-guide/core-network-guide#BKMK_deployNPS1).

If you want to deploy authentication methods like Extensible Authentication Protocol \(EAP\) and Protected EAP that require the use of server certificates on your NPS server, you can deploy NPS server certificates with the guide [Deploy Server Certificates for 802.1X Wired and Wireless Deployments](https://technet.microsoft.com/windows-server-docs/networking/core-network-guide/cncg/server-certs/deploy-server-certificates-for-802.1x-wired-and-wireless-deployments).

To deploy NPS for wireless access, you can use the guide [Deploy Password-Based 802.1X Authenticated Wireless Access](https://technet.microsoft.com/windows-server-docs/networking/core-network-guide/cncg/wireless/a-deploy-8021x-wireless-access).
