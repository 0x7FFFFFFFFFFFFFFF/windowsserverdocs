# Windows PowerShell Commands for RSS and vRSS

>Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

You can use this topic to quickly locate technical reference information about Windows PowerShell commands for Receive Side Scaling \(RSS\) and virtual RSS \(vRSS\).

>[!NOTE]
>You can use the following RSS commands to configure RSS on a physical computer that has multiple processors or multiple cores. You can use the same commands to configure vRSS on a virtual machine \(VM\) that is running a supported operating system. 

The following RSS and vRSS configuration commands are part of the Network Adapter Cmdlets in Windows PowerShell. For more information, see [Network Adapter Cmdlets in Windows PowerShell](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj134956.aspx).

## Configure VMQ

vRSS requires that VMQ is enabled and configured. You can use the following Windows PowerShell commands to manage VMQ settings.

- [Disable-NetAdapterVmq](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/powershell/windows/netadapter/disable-netadaptervmq)
- [Enable-NetAdapterVmq](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/powershell/windows/netadapter/enable-netadaptervmq)
- [Get-NetAdapterVmq](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/powershell/windows/netadapter/get-netadaptervmq)
- [Set-NetAdapterVmq](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/powershell/windows/netadapter/set-netadaptervmq)

## Enable and configure RSS on a native host

The following PowerShell commands allow you to configure RSS on a native host. Some of the parameters of these commands might also affect Virtual Machine Queue \(VMQ\) in the Hyper-V host. You can use these commands to manage RSS in a VM or on a host virtual NIC \(vNIC\). 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Enabling RSS in a VM or on a host vNIC is a prerequisite for enabling and using vRSS.

- [Disable-NetAdapterRss](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj130892.aspx)
- [Enable-NetAdapterRss](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj130859.aspx)
- [Get-NetAdapterRss](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj130912.aspx)
- [Set-NetAdapterRss](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj130863.aspx)

## Enable vRSS on the Hyper\-V Virtual Switch port

In addition to enabling RSS in the VM, vRSS requires that you enable vRSS on the Hyper\-V Virtual Switch port. To determine the present settings for vRSS and to enable or disable the feature for a VM, you can use the following Windows PowerShell commands.

    
    Get-VMNetworkAdapter <vm-name> | fl
    Set-VMNetworkAdapter <vm-name> -VrssEnabled [$True|$False]
    

## Enable or disable vRSS on a host vNIC

To determine the present settings for vRSS, and to enable or disable the feature for a host vNIC, you can use the following Windows PowerShell commands.

    
    Get-VMNetworkAdapter -ManagementOS | fl
    Set-VMNetworkAdapter -ManagementOS -VrssEnabled [$True|$False]
    

## Configure the Scheduling Mode on the Hyper-V Virtual Switch port
>Applies to: Windows Server 2019

In Windows Server 2019, vRSS can update the logical processors used to process network traffic dynamically.  By default, this scheduling mode is enabled on devices with supported drivers. To determine the present scheduling mode on a system, or to modify the scheduling mode for a VM, use the following Windows PowerShell commands:

    Get-VMNetworkAdapter <vm-name> | Select *VRSSQueue*
    Set-VMNetworkAdapter <vm-name> -VrssQueueSchedulingMode [Dynamic|$StaticVrss|StaticVMQ]


## Configure the Scheduling Mode on a host vNIC
>Applies to: Windows Server 2019

To determine the present scheduling mode or modify the scheduling mode for a host vNIC, use the following Windows PowerShell commands:

    Get-VMNetworkAdapter -ManagementOS | Select *VRSSQueue*
    Set-VMNetworkAdapter -ManagementOS -VrssQueueSchedulingMode -VrssQueueSchedulingMode [Dynamic|$StaticVrss|StaticVMQ]


For more information, see the following reference topics.

- [Get-VMNetworkAdapter](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/powershell/windows/hyper-v/get-vmnetworkadapter)
- [Set-VMNetworkAdapter](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/powershell/windows/hyper-v/set-vmnetworkadapter)
