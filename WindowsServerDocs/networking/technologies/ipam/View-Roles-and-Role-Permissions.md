# View Roles and Role Permissions

>Applies To: Windows Server Technical Preview

You can use this topic to view Access Control user roles in the IPAM client console.  
  
Membership in **Administrators**, or equivalent, is the minimum required to perform this procedure.  
  
### To view Access Control roles  
  
1.  In Server Manager, click  **IPAM**. The IPAM client console appears.  
  
2.  In the navigation pane, click **ACCESS CONTROL**.  
  
3.  In the lower navigation pane, click **Roles**. In the display pane, the roles are listed.
