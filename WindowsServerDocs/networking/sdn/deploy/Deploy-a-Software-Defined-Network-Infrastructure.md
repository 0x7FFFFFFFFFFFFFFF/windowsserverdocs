# Deploy a Software Defined Network Infrastructure
The following topics describe the methods you can use to deploy Microsoft's Software Defined Networking (SDN) infrastructure.   
  
These deployments include all the technologies you need for a fully functional infrastructure, including Hyper-V Network Virtualization (HNV), network controllers, software load balancers (SLB/MUX), and gateways.  
  
    
  
-   [Deploy a Software Defined Network infrastructure using VMM](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt695701(v=sc.16).aspx)  
  
    Use this method if you want to incorporate System Center Virtual Machine Manger (VMM) to manage your SDN infrastructure.  
  
-   [Deploy a Software Defined Network infrastructure using scripts](../../sdn/deploy/Deploy-a-Software-Defined-Network-infrastructure-using-scripts.md)  
  
    Use this method if you do not want to use VMM to manage your SDN infrastructure, or if you have another management method.  
  
 If you want to deploy individual SDN technologies instead of an entire infrastructure, see:  
[Deploy Software Defined Network Technologies using Windows PowerShell](Deploy-Software-Defined-Network-Technologies-using-Windows-PowerShell.md).    
  
For more information about SDN, see:  
[Software Defined Networking &#40;SDN&#41;](Software-Defined-Networking--SDN-.md)
