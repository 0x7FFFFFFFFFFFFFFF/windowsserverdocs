#System Center Technologies for Software Defined Networking  
System Center includes the following technologies for use with software defined networking.  
  
-   [System Center Operations Manager](#bkmk_scom)  
  
-   [System Center Virtual Machine Manager](#bkmk_scvmm)  
  
-   [Windows Server Gateway](#bkmk_wsgateway)  
  
### <a name="bkmk_scom"></a>System Center Operations Manager  
System Center 2012 Operations Manager provides infrastructure monitoring that is flexible and cost-effective, helps ensure the predictable performance and availability of vital applications, and offers comprehensive monitoring for your datacenter and cloud, both private and public.  
  
For more information, see [Operations Manager](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh205987.aspx).  
  
### <a name="bkmk_scvmm"></a>System Center Virtual Machine Manager  
With  System Center 2012 SP1 Virtual Machine Manager, you can provision and manage virtual networks at scale. You can define and control virtual network policies centrally and link them to your applications or workloads. When your workload is deployed or moved, the network configuration adjusts itself automatically. This is important because it removes the need for manual reconfiguration of network hardware, thereby reducing operational complexity while saving your valuable resources for higher-impact work. Virtual Machine Manager also helps you to control traffic flow between virtual networks, including the ability to define guaranteed bandwidth for your critical applications and workloads.  
  
For more information, see [Virtual Machine Manager](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/gg610610.aspx).  
  
### <a name="bkmk_wsgateway"></a>Windows Server Gateway  
To deploy Windows Server Gateway, you must use System Center 2012 R2 and Virtual Machine Manager. The Windows Server Gateway router is designed for use with multitenant deployments. With the System Center 2012 R2 Virtual Machine Manager Windows Server Gateway router, only a very limited set of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) configuration options are available in the Virtual Machine Manager software interface, including Local BGP IP Address and Autonomous System Numbers (ASN), List of BGP Peer IP Addresses, and ASN, values. You can, however, use Remote Access Windows PowerShell BGP commands to configure all other features of Windows Server Gateway.
