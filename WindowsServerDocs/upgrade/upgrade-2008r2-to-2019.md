# Upgrade Windows Server 2008 R2 to Windows Server 2019

Perform an in-place upgrade starting with Windows Server 2008 R2, going through Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2016, ending with Windows Server 2019. You can stop your upgrade process at any of the operating systems. However, we recommend moving to Windows Server 2019 so you can take advantage of the upgraded features and performance.
