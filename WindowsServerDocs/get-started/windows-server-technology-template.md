# Technology in Windows Server 2016 

<img src="6networking.png" style='align:left'> *Introduction to technology. This should help connect the marketing position for the technology to the content. Change the icon to the one used for your technology area on the [landing page](windows-server-landing.md).*

*The goal is to bring the customer from the marketing story of the technology into the content that helps them implement it in their environment.*

*For an example, see the [Networking](windows-server-technology-area.md) page.* 

>[!Note]
> To download Windows Server 2016, see [Windows Server Evaluations](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-technical-preview).

*Introduce new and exciting features here.*

*Provide links into your content - each link should be either an H2 or an H3 (instead of tables or bullets). See the Networking article for an example.*
