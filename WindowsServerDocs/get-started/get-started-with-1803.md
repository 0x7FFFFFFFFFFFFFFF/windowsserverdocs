# Introducing Windows Server, version 1903

>Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel)

** Windows Server, version 1903 is the current release in the Semi-Annual Channel**

## What the Semi-Annual Channel is and isn't

Windows Server Semi-Annual Channel is the current twice-yearly server release designed for customers who are moving at a â€œcloud cadence," such as those on rapid development cycles. This track is ideal for modern applications and innovation scenarios such as containers and micro-services. Each release in this track is supported for 18 months from the initial release. For more about Semi-Annual Channel, plus **tips for deciding which channel to join** (or remain on) see [Semi-Annual Channel Overview](semi-annual-channel-overview.md).

Semi-Annual Channel releases aren't "updates" or "service packs" for Windows Server.

**Windows Server 2019 is the current Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) product.** The LTSC is best if you need long-term stability and predictability in your server operating system to support traditional workloads and applications. If you want to stay in the LTSC, you should install (or continue using) Windows Server 2019, which can be installed in either Server Core mode or Server with Desktop Experience mode. See [Get Started with Windows Server 2019](../get-started-19/get-started-19.md) for details.
