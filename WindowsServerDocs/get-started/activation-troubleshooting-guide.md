# Windows activation troubleshooting guide

## How it works

Product activation is the process of validating software after it has been installed on a specific computer. Activation confirms that the product is genuine—not a fraudulent copy—and that the product key or serial number is valid and has not been compromised or revoked. Activation also establishes a link or relationship between the product key and the installation.

## Best Practices

Volume licensing offers customized programs that are tailored to the size and purchasing preference of the organization. To become a volume licensing customer, the organization must set up a volume licensing agreement with Microsoft. There is a common misunderstanding about acquiring licenses for a new computer through volume licensing.
