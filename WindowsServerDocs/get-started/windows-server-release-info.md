# Windows Server release information

Microsoft has updated its servicing model. Starting with Windows Server 2022 there is one primary release channel available, the Long-Term Servicing Channel. The Semi-Annual Channel will still be supported up to the dates shown in the table below. This page is designed to help you determine the end of support date for the Long-Term Servicing Channel and Semi-Annual Channel releases.

The Semi-Annual Channel in previous versions of Windows Server focused on containers and microservices, and that innovation will continue with [Azure Stack HCI](/azure-stack/hci/). With the Long-Term Servicing Channel, a new major version of Windows Server is released every 2-3 years. Users are entitled to 5 years of mainstream support and 5 years of extended support. This channel provides systems with a long servicing option and functional stability, and can be installed with Server Core or Server with Desktop Experience installation options. The Long-Term Servicing Channel will continue to receive security and non-security updates, but it will not receive the new features and functionality.
