# How to use Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2 Extended Security Updates (ESU)

>Applies To: Windows Server 2008 / 2008 R2

Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2 reach the end of their support lifecycle on January 14, 2020. Windows Server Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) has a minimum of ten years of support - five years for mainstream support and five years for extended support. This support includes regular security updates.

End of support also means the end of security updates. This scenario can cause security or compliance issues and put business applications at risk. Microsoft recommends that you [upgrade to the current version of Windows Server](modernize-windows-server-2008.md) for the most advanced security, performance, and innovation.

If you can't upgrade all your servers by the end of support lifecycle deadline, the following options help protect applications and data during the upgrade transition:

* Migrate existing Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2 workloads as-is to Azure Virtual Machines (VMs).
    * This migration to Azure automatically provides an additional three years of Extended Security Updates. There's no additional charge for ESU on top of Azure VM's cost.
* Purchase an Extended Security Update subscription for your servers and remain protected until you're ready to upgrade to a newer Windows Server version.
    * These Extended Security Updates are provided for up to three years after the end of support lifecycle date.

## What are Extended Security Updates for Windows Server?

Extended Security Updates (ESUs) for Windows Server include security updates and bulletins rated *critical* and *important*, for a maximum of three years after January 14, 2020. ESUs don't include the following:

* New features
* Customer-requested non-security hotfixes
* Design change requests

For more information, see the [Extended Security Updates frequently asked questions](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/extended-security-updates).

## Register for Extended Security Updates

To use ESUs, you create a Multiple Activation Key (MAK) and apply it to Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2 computers. This MAK lets the Windows Update servers know that you can continue to receive security updates.

To register for ESUs and create a MAK, complete the following steps in the Azure Portal:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. In the search box at the top of the Azure Portal, search for and select **Extended Security Updates**.

    -- INSERT IMAGE --

    If you haven't use ESUs before, chose to **+ Create** an Extended Security Updates resource first. Otherwise, select your resource from the list.

1. Under **View and create Multiple Activation Keys**, select **View keys**. To create your first Multiple Activation Key, select **Create key**.

    -- INSERT IMAGE --

1. Select your subscription, resource group, and location to create the key.

    Under **Key details**, enter the following information:

    | Setting             | Value |
    |---------------------|-------|
    | Key name            | A display name for your key, such *Agreement01*. |
    | Agreement number    | Your agreement number generated by the volume licensing contract management system, or MSLicense for Enterprise Agreement programs. |
    | Number of computers | Choose the number of computers on which you want to install Extended Security Updates with this key.â€‹ |
    | OS type             | Choose the operating system to use this key with, such as Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2008 R2. |
    | Support type        | Choose the type of support for this key, depending on your existing agreement. |

    -- INSERT IMAGE --

    When ready, select **Review + create**.

1. If the validation passed, you are presented with a screen that summarizes the choices for the new registry resource. The Azure [Terms of Use](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/) and [Privacy Policy](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement) are available.

    Check the box to confirm that you have eligible computers and the key is only to be used within your organization:

    ![Confirm that the key will only be used by your organization](media/extended-security-updates/confirm-key-usage.png)

    When ready, select **Create** to deploy the new resource.

Extended Security Updates registration is now available for use with your computers. The MAK created should be applied to Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2 computers that you wish to remain eligible for security updates.

## Download and apply Extended Security Updates

Delivery, download and application of Extended Security Updates for Windows Server is no different than existing deployment processes. The updates are only for *Security*, and are released every Patch Tuesday.

You can install the updates using whatever tools and processes already in place. The only difference is that the system must be unlocked using the key generated in the previous section for the updates to install.
