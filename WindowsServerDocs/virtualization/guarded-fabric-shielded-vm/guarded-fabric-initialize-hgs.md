# Initialize the Host Guardian Service (HGS)

When you initialize HGS, you specify the mode that HGS will use to measure the health of guarded hosts. There are two mutually exclusive options. The following topics cover detailed steps for each mode:

- [TPM-trusted attestation (TPM mode)](guarded-fabric-initialize-hgs-tpm-mode.md)
- [Admin-trusted attestation (AD mode)](guarded-fabric-initialize-hgs-ad-mode.md)

You should perform these steps on a physical server with Windows Server 2016 installed.
