# STEP 8: Snapshot the Configuration
This completes the DirectAccess with OTP Configuration test lab. To save this configuration so that you can quickly return to a working DirectAccess with OTP configuration from which you can test other DirectAccess modular test lab guides, test lab guide extensions, or for your own experimentation and learning, do the following:  
  
1.  On all physical computers or virtual machines in the test lab, close all windows and then perform a graceful shutdown.  
  
2.  If your lab is based on virtual machines, save a snapshot of each virtual machine and name the snapshots **OTP DA Configuration**. If your lab uses physical computers, create disk images to save the DirectAccess with OTP Configuration.
