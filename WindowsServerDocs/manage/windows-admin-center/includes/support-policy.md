Windows Admin Center releases are supported continuously, based on Microsoftâ€™s Modern Lifecycle Policy. This means that only the latest released version of Windows Admin Center is serviced and supported, and users must stay current by upgrading to the latest Windows Admin Center release within 30 days of availability to remain supported. New versions are released typically twice a year. This policy applies to both the Windows Admin Center platform itself, as well as any released (not preview) Microsoft extensions published in the Windows Admin Center extension feed. Note that some extensions may be updated more frequently than others, between Windows Admin Center releases.

Windows Admin Center Insider Preview releases are covered by the support policy of the Insider Preview program.
