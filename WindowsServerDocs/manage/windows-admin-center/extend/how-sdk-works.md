# Extensibility and SDK in Windows Admin Center

>Applies To: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows 10

Windows Admin Center is built as an extensible platform where each connection type and tool is an extension that you can install, uninstall and update individually. You can develop Windows Admin Center extensions that extend existing capabilities or enable new management scenarios through the Windows Admin Center platform. You can then release your extension publicly or internally to use within your organization.

The Windows Admin Center SDK will soon launch in public preview. As a platform, growing our ecosystem and enabling partner extensibility has been a key priority since the beginning. We’ve been working with early-adopter partners to refine the extension development experience in a private preview of our SDK. Look for a public preview SDK release announcement in the coming weeks, and if you’re going to the Microsoft Build conference in May, be sure to stop by our booth.
