## Guides
Here are some guides for developing with the Windows Admin Center SDK:

- [Add a module to a tool extension](guides/add-module.md)
- [Add an iFrame to a tool extension](guides/add-iframe.md)
- [Use a custom gateway plugin in your tool extension](guides/use-custom-gateway-plugin.md)
- [Create a connection provider](guides/create-connection-provider.md)
- [Modify root navigation behavior](guides/modify-root-navigation.md)
- [Control your tool's visibility](guides/dynamic-tool-display.md)
- [Strings and localization](guides/strings-localization.md)
- [Using PowerShell in your extension](guides/powershell.md)

## Sample code included with the SDK

- Sample code can be found for [tool](develop-tool.md), [solution](develop-solution.md), and [gateway plugin](develop-gateway-plugin.md) extension types in our SDK documentation. There you will leverage the Windows Admin Center CLI to build a new extension project, then follow the individual guides to customize your project to meet your needs.

- [Developer Tools](https://aka.ms/wacsdk), hosted on  our GitHub SDK site, is a solution extension containing a rich collection of controls that you can browse and use in your own extension.  Developer Tools is a fully functioning extension that can be side-loaded into Windows Admin Center in Developer Mode.
