# Microsoft Identity Manager Technical Preview
MIM 2016 builds on the already strong identity and access management capabilities of FIM 2010 and adds modernization, hybrid experience and privilege access management capabilities.

## Hybrid experience
Microsoft Identity Manager 2016 provides support for hybrid reporting between MIM and Azure. In addition, the new Self Service Password Reset portal supports Azure multifactor authentication.

## Privileged Access Management
Privileged Access Management controls and manages administrative access by providing temporary, task\-based access to administrative privileges for users eliminating the carte blanche administrative access coveted by cyber attackers. In addition, Privileged Access Management extracts and isolates administrative accounts from existing Active Directory forests.

## Modernization
This version of Microsoft Identity Manager supports an updated list of products and platforms including the latest Microsoft platforms and Office\/server stacks, Windows Client OS, Windows Server OS, SharePoint, SQL and Outlook. New features such as PAM and CM support RESTful APIs. In Certificate Management weâ€™ve added support for multi\-forest topologies, a modernized app for virtual smartcard and certificate lifecycle management, events and troubleshooting capabilities. In addition CM now provides a RESTful API and supports modern authorization \(OAuth2\). Self\-service scenarios now include Account Unlock and multifactor authentication gate for Password Reset.

New platforms are supported:

-   Windows Client 8.1

-   Windows Server 2012 R2

-   SQL 2014

-   SharePoint 2013

-   Outlook 2013

-   Internet Explorer 8 or higher
