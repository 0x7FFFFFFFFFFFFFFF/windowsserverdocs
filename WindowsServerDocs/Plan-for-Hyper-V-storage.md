# Plan for Hyper-V storage
**This is preliminary content and subject to change.**

Hyper-V offers a variety of storage options to address different needs and budgets. This includes different types of physical and virtual storage as well as features to help you use the storage more efficiently.

## Virtual machines and storage subsystems
There are two main 'levels' of storage for Hyper-V -- the storage available for use by the virtual machine and the storage available to the host.
VM level - virtual hard disks (2 types), pass-through disks, DDA 
Hyper-V level - Storage spaces direct, clustered storage, storage quality of service

## Virtual machine and guest considerations
Discuss compatibility? In some cases the guest OS affects your choice, ie some older but supported OS's might not work with certain storage options
