**To initialize new disks**
1.  In Disk Management, right-click the disk you want to initialize, and then click **Initialize Disk**.

2.  In the **Initialize Disk** dialog box, select the disk(s) to initialize. You can select whether to use the master boot record (MBR) or GUID partition table (GPT) partition style.

#### Additional considerations

-   New disks appear as **Not Initialized**. Before you can use a disk, you must first initialize it. If you start Disk Management after adding a disk, the Initialize Disk Wizard appears so you can initialize the disk.
