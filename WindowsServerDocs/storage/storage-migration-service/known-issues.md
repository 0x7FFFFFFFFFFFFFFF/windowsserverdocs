# Storage Migration Service known issues

This topic contains answers to known issues (KIs) when using [Storage Migration Service](overview.md) to migrate servers.

## <a name="collecting-logs"></a> How to collect log files when working with Microsoft Support

The Storage Migration Service contains event logs for the Orchestrator service and the Proxy Service. The urchestrator server always contains both event logs, and destination servers with the proxy service installed contain the proxy logs. These logs are located under:

- Application and Services Logs \ Microsoft \ Windows \ StorageMigrationService
- Application and Services Logs \ Microsoft \ Windows \ StorageMigrationService-Proxy

If you need to gather these logs for offline viewing or to send to Microsoft Support, there is an open source PowerShell script available on GitHub:

 [Storage Migration Service Helper](https://aka.ms/smslogs) 

Review the README for usage.
