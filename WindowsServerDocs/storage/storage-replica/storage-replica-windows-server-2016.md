# Storage Replica in Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview

>Applies To: Windows Server Technical Preview

Storage Replica is a new feature in Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview that enables storage-agnostic, block-level, synchronous replication between clusters or servers for disaster preparedness and recovery, as well as stretching of a failover cluster across sites for high availability. Synchronous replication enables mirroring of data in physical sites with crash-consistent volumes, ensuring zero data loss at the file system level. Asynchronous replication allows site extension beyond metropolitan ranges.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This preview release should not be used in production environments.
