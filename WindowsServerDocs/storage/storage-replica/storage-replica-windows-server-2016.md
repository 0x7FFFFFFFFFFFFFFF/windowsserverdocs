# Storage Replica in Windows Server 2016

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016

Storage Replica is a new feature in Windows Server 2016 that enables storage-agnostic, block-level, synchronous replication between clusters or servers for disaster preparedness and recovery, as well as stretching of a failover cluster across sites for high availability. Synchronous replication enables mirroring of data in physical sites with crash-consistent volumes, ensuring zero data loss at the file system level. Asynchronous replication allows site extension beyond metropolitan ranges.  


This guide includes information that enables you to configure Storage Replica in a stretch cluster, between servers, or between clusters. It includes the following topics:
