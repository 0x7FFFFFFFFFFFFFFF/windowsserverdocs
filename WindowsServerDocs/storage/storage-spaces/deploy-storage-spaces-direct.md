# Deploying Storage Spaces Direct

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016

Storage Spaces Direct is a Windows Server-based storage solution that uses industry-standard servers with local-attached drives to create highly available, highly scalable software-defined storage.

   >[!NOTE]
   > For production environments we recommend acquiring a Windows Server Software-Defined hardware/software offering, which includes production deployment tools and procedures. These offerings are designed, assembled, and validated to meet Microsoft's requirements for private cloud environments, helping ensure reliable operation.
