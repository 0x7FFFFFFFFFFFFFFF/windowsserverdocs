# Plan a Basic DirectAccess Deployment
This topic describes the planning steps required to deploy a single DirectAccess server running [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_1](includes/winthreshold_server_1_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[winblue_server_1](includes/winblue_server_1_md.md)], or [!INCLUDE[win8_server_1](includes/win8_server_1_md.md)] with basic features:

1.  [Step 1: Plan the DirectAccess Infrastructure](Step-1--Plan-the-DirectAccess-Infrastructure.md)—Plan network and server topology, firewall settings, certificate requirements, DNS and Active Directory.

2.  [Step 2: Plan the DirectAccess Deployment](Step-2--Plan-the-DirectAccess-Deployment.md)—Plan client and server deployment.

## Next step
After you have completed these planning steps, you can begin the server deployment. For instructions, see [Install and Configure Basic DirectAccess](Install-and-Configure-Basic-DirectAccess.md).
