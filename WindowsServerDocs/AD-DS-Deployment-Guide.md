# AD DS Deployment Guide
By deploying [!INCLUDE[firstref_longhorn](includes/firstref_longhorn_md.md)] Active Directory® Domain Services \(AD DS\) in your environment, you can take advantage of the centralized, delegated administrative model and single sign\-on \(SSO\) capability that AD DS provides. After you identify the deployment tasks and current environment for your organization, you can apply the AD DS deployment strategy that meets your organization’s needs.

## About this guide
This guide is intended for use by system administrators and system engineers. It provides detailed guidance for deploying an AD DS design that has been preselected by you or an infrastructure specialist or system architect in your organization.

If a design has not yet been selected, we recommend that you wait to follow the instructions in this guide until after you have reviewed the various design options in the [AD DS Design Guide \[longhorn\]](assetId:///817d84f0-a0c3-4776-8ea3-20054f342a70) and you have selected the most appropriate design for your organization.

> [!NOTE]
> The information in this guide also applies to [!INCLUDE[nextref_server_7](includes/nextref_server_7_md.md)] AD DS.
