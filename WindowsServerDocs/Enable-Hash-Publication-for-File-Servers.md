# Enable Hash Publication for File Servers
You can enable BranchCache hash publication on one file server or on multiple file servers.  
  
-   To enable hash publication on one file server using local computer Group Policy, see [Enable Hash Publication for Non-Domain Member File Servers](Enable-Hash-Publication-for-Non-Domain-Member-File-Servers.md).  
  
-   To enable hash publication on multiple file servers using domain Group Policy, see [Enable Hash Publication for Domain Member File Servers](Enable-Hash-Publication-for-Domain-Member-File-Servers.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> If you have multiple file servers and you want to enable hash publication per share, rather than enabling hash publication for all shares, you can use the instructions in the topic [Enable Hash Publication for Non-Domain Member File Servers](Enable-Hash-Publication-for-Non-Domain-Member-File-Servers.md).
