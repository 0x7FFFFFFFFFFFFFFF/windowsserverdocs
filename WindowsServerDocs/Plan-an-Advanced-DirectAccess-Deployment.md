# Plan an Advanced DirectAccess Deployment
This topic lists the planning steps that are required to deploy a single DirectAccess server running [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_1](includes/winthreshold_server_1_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[winblue_server_1](includes/winblue_server_1_md.md)], or [!INCLUDE[win8_server_1](includes/win8_server_1_md.md)] with a full range of basic and advanced features. The planning phase includes the following topics.

-   [Step 1: Plan the DirectAccess Infrastructure_1](Step-1--Plan-the-DirectAccess-Infrastructure_1.md)

    In this phase, you plan your network and server topology, firewall settings, certificate requirements, the Domain Name System \(DNS\), Active Directory, DirectAccess management servers, and the DirectAccess network location server.

-   [Step 2: Plan DirectAccess Deployments](Step-2--Plan-DirectAccess-Deployments.md)

    In this phase, you plan for the client and server deployment, including the DirectAccess infrastructure and the application servers.

## Next step
After you have completed these planning steps, you can begin the server deployment. For instructions, see [Install and Configure Advanced DirectAccess](Install-and-Configure-Advanced-DirectAccess.md).
