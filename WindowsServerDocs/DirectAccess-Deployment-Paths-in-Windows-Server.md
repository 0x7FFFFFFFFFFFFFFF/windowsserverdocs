# DirectAccess Deployment Paths in Windows Server
This topic provides a listing of the documentation for the two main Remote Access deployment paths: **Basic** and **Advanced**.  
  
You can use the section below to gain an understanding of the differences between the DirectAccess Basic and Advanced deployment paths, and you can use the documentation links to locate the deployment guide that is best suited to your goals.  
  
## Deploy Basic DirectAccess  
With a basic DirectAccess deployment, DirectAccess is configured with default settings by using a wizard, without any need to configure infrastructure settings such as a certification authority \(CA\) or Active Directory security groups.  
  
-   [Deploy a Single DirectAccess Server Using the Getting Started Wizard](Deploy-a-Single-DirectAccess-Server-Using-the-Getting-Started-Wizard.md). You can use this guide to deploy basic DirectAccess in a production environment.  
  
## Deploy Advanced DirectAccess  
With an advanced DirectAccess deployment, you deploy a single DirectAccess server and configure network infrastructure servers to support DirectAccess.  
  
-   [Deploy a Single DirectAccess Server with Advanced Settings](Deploy-a-Single-DirectAccess-Server-with-Advanced-Settings.md). You can use this guide to deploy DirectAccess with advanced settings in a production environment.
