# Planning Federation Server Proxy Placement
After you gather all the information that you will use to design your [!INCLUDE[firstref_adfs2]()] infrastructure and after you plan your [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs]()] and Web server strategy, you can plan when and where to place [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs]()] proxies in your new design. The information in the following topics can help you determine when and where to place a [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fsp]()] and whether to configure it for the account partner role or the resource partner role:  
  
-   [Review the Role of the Federation Server in the Account Partner]()  
  
-   [Review the Role of the Federation Server Proxy in the Resource Partner]()  
  
-   [When to Create a Federation Server Proxy]()  
  
-   [Where to Place a Federation Server Proxy]()  
  
-   [When to Create a Federation Server Proxy Farm]()  
  
-   [Certificate Requirements for Federation Server Proxies]()  
  
-   [Name Resolution Requirements for Federation Server Proxies]()  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Although this information might help with your placement planning for [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs]()] proxies, it does not explain how to determine the proper number of proxies and the proxy hardware requirements for each [!INCLUDE[nextref_adfs2]()] design.  
  
For examples of how you can place a [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fsp]()] in either of the two primary [!INCLUDE[nextref_adfs2]()] design scenarios, see [Mapping Your Deployment Goals to an AD FS Design](../../../active-directory-federation-services/plan/WS2012-guide/Mapping-Your-Deployment-Goals-to-an-AD-FS-Design.md).
