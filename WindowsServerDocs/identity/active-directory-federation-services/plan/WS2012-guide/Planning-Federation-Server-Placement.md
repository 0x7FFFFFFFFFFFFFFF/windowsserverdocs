# Planning Federation Server Placement
The most critical component of an [!INCLUDE[firstref_adfs2]()] deployment is the [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs]()]. Therefore, it is important that you plan your [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs]()] placement strategy carefully, including when and where to deploy [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs]()]s. The information in the following topics can help you determine when and where to create a [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs]()] or [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs]()] farm and whether to use that [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs]()] in the account partner role, the resource partner role, or both:

> [!NOTE]  
> Although this information might help with your placement planning for [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs]()]s, it does not explain how to determine the proper number of [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs]()]s and the hardware requirements for each [!INCLUDE[nextref_adfs2]()] design.  
  
For examples of how a [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs]()] can be placed in any of the two primary [!INCLUDE[nextref_adfs2]()] design scenarios, see [Mapping Your Deployment Goals to an AD FS Design](../../../active-directory-federation-services/plan/WS2012-guide/Mapping-Your-Deployment-Goals-to-an-AD-FS-Design.md).
