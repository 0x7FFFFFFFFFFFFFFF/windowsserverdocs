# Understanding Active Directory Site Topology
Your site topology significantly affects the performance of your network and the ability of your users to access network resources. Before you begin to design your site topology, become familiar with the functions for sites in  Windows Server 2008 , the different network topologies that organizations commonly use, the role of the site topology owner, and some Active Directory replication concepts.
