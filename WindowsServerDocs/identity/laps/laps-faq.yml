  - name: General
    questions:
      - question: I only want to use legacy Microsoft LAPS, how can I uninstall Windows LAPS?
        answer: |
          Windows LAPS is considered a Windows baseline security feature and can't be
          uninstalled. To prevent any chance of conflict between the two features, you should avoid
          configuring or applying any new Windows LAPS policies, and also
          [Disable legacy LAPS emulation mode](/windows-server/identity/laps/laps-scenarios-legacy#disabling-legacy-microsoft-laps-emulation-mode).

      - question: Is it supported to run legacy Microsoft LAPS side-by-side with Windows LAPS?
        answer: |
          Yes, this scenario is supported with the following conditions. A new Windows LAPS policy
          must be configured, and you must take care to configure Windows LAPS and the legacy LAPS
          to manage different local accounts.

      - question: Is it supported to run 3rd-party local account password manager products side-by-side with Windows LAPS?
        answer: |  
          Yes, this scenario is supported with the following condition. You must take care to
          configure Windows LAPS and the 3rd-party product to manage different local accounts. If
          you mistakenly configure both to manage the same account, Windows LAPS rejects attempts by
          the 3rd-party product to modify the account's password with a
          `STATUS_POLICY_CONTROLLED_ACCOUNT\ERROR_POLICY_CONTROLLED_ACCOUNT` error. Each such
          rejection is noted with a 10031 event in the Windows LAPS event log channel.

      - question: Why isn't the Windows LAPS PowerShell module hosted on GitHub, PowerShell Gallery, or similar?
        answer: |
          The Windows LAPS PowerShell module is part of Windows and not available outside of
          the operating system.

      - question: How can I copy the Windows LAPS PowerShell module to an older operating system?
        answer: This scenario isn't supported.

      - question: How can I copy the Windows LAPS-enabled Active Directory User and Computers snap-in to an older operating system?
        answer: This scenario isn't supported.

      - question: Microsoft promotes a password-less strategy and direction. Why was a password-based feature like Windows LAPS built?
        answer: |
          All Windows LAPS scenarios involve the management of a Windows local account's password
          for use with help desk tasks, device recovery, and other scenarios. Since Windows only
          supports password-based authentication for local accounts, password management is
          necessary.
