title: Windows LAPS frequently asked questions
summary: |
  This article provides answers to many commonly asked questions about Windows Local Administrator
  Password Solution (Windows LAPS).

sections:
  - name: General
    questions:
      - question: I only want to use legacy Microsoft LAPS, how can I uninstall Windows LAPS?
        answer: |
          Windows LAPS is considered a Windows baseline security feature and can't be
          uninstalled. To prevent any chance of conflict between the two features, you should avoid
          configuring or applying any new Windows LAPS policies, and also
          [Disable legacy LAPS emulation mode](/windows-server/identity/laps/laps-scenarios-legacy#disabling-legacy-microsoft-laps-emulation-mode).

      - question: Is it supported to run legacy Microsoft LAPS side-by-side with Windows LAPS?
        answer: |
          Yes, this scenario is supported with the following conditions. A new Windows LAPS policy
          must be configured, and you must take care to configure Windows LAPS and the legacy LAPS
          to manage different local accounts.

      - question: Can I deploy and use Windows LAPS even if my domain is running older domain controllers?
        answer: |
          Yes with some limitations. See [Domain functional level and domain controller version requirements](laps-scenarios-windows-server-active-directory.md#domain-functional-level-and-domain-controller-os-version-requirements).

      - question: Can I deploy and use Windows LAPS even if my domain isn't yet at Windows Server 2016 Domain Functional Level?
        answer: |
          Yes with some limitations. See [Domain functional level and domain controller version requirements](laps-scenarios-windows-server-active-directory.md#domain-functional-level-and-domain-controller-os-version-requirements).

      - question: Do I need to deploy a Windows Server 2022 or 2019 DC in order to extend my forest's schema with the Windows LAPS schema extensions?
        answer: |
          No - you can run the `Update-LapsADSchema` cmdlet from any operating system updated with the Windows LAPS
          feature. The only requirement is that the client credentials are authorized to modify the Active Directory
          schema. See [Update the Windows Server Active Directory schema](laps-scenarios-windows-server-active-directory.md#update-the-windows-server-active-directory-schema).

      - question: Do I need to extend my forest's schema if I'm only planning to backup passwords to Azure AD?
        answer: |
          No.

      - question: Do I need Intune in order to use Windows LAPS?
        answer: |
          No. It's supported to deploy and use Windows LAPS in either Active Directory or Azure AD mode
          without Intune. Intune does provide many benefits to the Windows LAPS scenario (for example,
          policy deployment at scale, monitoring, and password-reset action support).

      - question: Do I need Azure AD Connect in order to use Windows LAPS?
        answer: |
          No. There are no dependencies between these two features. Managed Windows LAPS devices back up
          their passwords to Azure AD directly via https and doesn't rely at all on data synchronization
          techniques.

      - question: How do I configure a hybrid-joined device to back up the password to both Azure AD and AD?
        answer: This scenario isn't supported. You can only back up the password to one directory at a time.

      - question: Is it supported to run 3rd-party local account password manager products side-by-side with Windows LAPS?
        answer: |  
          Yes, this scenario is supported with the following condition. You must take care to
          configure Windows LAPS and the 3rd-party product to manage different local accounts. If
          you mistakenly configure both to manage the same account, Windows LAPS rejects attempts by
          the 3rd-party product to modify the account's password. See [Account password tampering protection](laps-concepts.md#account-password-tampering-protection).

      - question: Why can't I change the password of a local admin account currently managed by Windows LAPS?
        answer: |
          Windows LAPS prevents accidental or spurious changes to the managed account's password. This protection
          helps prevent a torn state situation where the password stored in the directory doesn't match the password
          stored locally on the device. See [Account password tampering protection](laps-concepts.md#account-password-tampering-protection).

      - question: Why isn't the Windows LAPS PowerShell module hosted on GitHub, PowerShell Gallery, or similar?
        answer: |
          The Windows LAPS PowerShell module is part of Windows and not available outside of
          the operating system.

      - question: How can I copy the Windows LAPS PowerShell module to an older operating system?
        answer: This scenario isn't supported.

      - question: How can I copy the Windows LAPS-enabled Active Directory User and Computers snap-in to an older operating system?
        answer: This scenario isn't supported.

      - question: I installed RSAT and I still don't see the new LAPS-enabled Active Directory User and Computers snap-in?
        answer: |
          The new snap-in isn't currently installed as part of RSAT. See [Windows LAPS snap-in availability](laps-management-user-interface.md#windows-laps-snap-in-availability).

      - question: Are Windows LAPS DSRM passwords available during a catastrophic AD disaster scenario?
        answer: |
          Windows LAPS DSRM password backup is only one component of a comprehensive Active Directory disaster recovery plan. For more information, see [DSRM password support](laps-concepts.md#dsrm-password-support).

      - question: Microsoft promotes a password-less strategy and direction. Why was a password-based feature like Windows LAPS added to Windows?
        answer: |
          All Windows LAPS scenarios involve the management of a Windows local account's password
          for use with help desk tasks, device recovery, and other scenarios. Since Windows only
          supports password-based authentication for local accounts, password management is
          necessary.

      - question: How can I submit unanswered questions or feature requests?
        answer: |
