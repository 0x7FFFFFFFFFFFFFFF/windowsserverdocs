# Mapping Your Deployment Goals to an AD FS Design
After you finish reviewing the existing [!INCLUDE[firstref_adfs2](includes/firstref_adfs2_md.md)] deployment goals and you determine which goals are related to your deployment, you can map those goals to a specific [!INCLUDE[nextref_adfs2](includes/nextref_adfs2_md.md)] design. For more information about [!INCLUDE[nextref_adfs2](includes/nextref_adfs2_md.md)] predefined deployment goals, see [Identifying Your AD FS Deployment Goals](Identifying-Your-AD-FS-Deployment-Goals.md).  
  
Use the following table to determine which [!INCLUDE[nextref_adfs2](includes/nextref_adfs2_md.md)] design maps to the appropriate combination of [!INCLUDE[nextref_adfs2](includes/nextref_adfs2_md.md)] deployment goals for your organization. This table refers only to the two primary [!INCLUDE[nextref_adfs2](includes/nextref_adfs2_md.md)] designs, as described in this guide. However, you can create a hybrid or custom [!INCLUDE[nextref_adfs2](includes/nextref_adfs2_md.md)] design by using any combination of the [!INCLUDE[nextref_adfs2](includes/nextref_adfs2_md.md)] deployment goals to meet the needs of your organization.
