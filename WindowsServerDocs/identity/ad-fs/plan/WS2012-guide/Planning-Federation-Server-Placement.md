# Planning Federation Server Placement
The most critical component of an [!INCLUDE[firstref_adfs2](includes/firstref_adfs2_md.md)] deployment is the [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs](includes/adfs2_fs_md.md)]. Therefore, it is important that you plan your [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs](includes/adfs2_fs_md.md)] placement strategy carefully, including when and where to deploy [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs](includes/adfs2_fs_md.md)]s. The information in the following topics can help you determine when and where to create a [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs](includes/adfs2_fs_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs](includes/adfs2_fs_md.md)] farm and whether to use that [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs](includes/adfs2_fs_md.md)] in the account partner role, the resource partner role, or both:

-   [Review the Role of the Federation Server in the Resource Partner](Review-the-Role-of-the-Federation-Server-in-the-Resource-Partner.md)  
  
-   [When to Create a Federation Server](When-to-Create-a-Federation-Server.md)  
  
-   [Where to Place a Federation Server](Where-to-Place-a-Federation-Server.md)  
  
-   [When to Create a Federation Server Farm](When-to-Create-a-Federation-Server-Farm.md)

> [!NOTE]  
> Although this information might help with your placement planning for [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs](includes/adfs2_fs_md.md)]s, it does not explain how to determine the proper number of [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs](includes/adfs2_fs_md.md)]s and the hardware requirements for each [!INCLUDE[nextref_adfs2](includes/nextref_adfs2_md.md)] design.  
  
For examples of how a [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs](includes/adfs2_fs_md.md)] can be placed in any of the two primary [!INCLUDE[nextref_adfs2](includes/nextref_adfs2_md.md)] design scenarios, see [Mapping Your Deployment Goals to an AD FS Design](Mapping-Your-Deployment-Goals-to-an-AD-FS-Design.md).
