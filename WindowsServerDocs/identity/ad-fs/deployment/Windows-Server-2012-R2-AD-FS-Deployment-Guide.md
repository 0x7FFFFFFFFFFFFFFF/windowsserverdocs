You can use Active Directory Federation Services \(AD FS\) with the  Windows Server 2012 R2  operating system to build a federated identity management solution that extends distributed identification, authentication, and authorization services to Web\-based applications across organization and platform boundaries. By deploying AD FS, you can extend your organization’s existing identity management capabilities to the Internet.
