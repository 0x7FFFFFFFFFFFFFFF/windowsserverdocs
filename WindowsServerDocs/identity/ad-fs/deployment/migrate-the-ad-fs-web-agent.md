# Migrate the AD FS web agent

To migrate the AD FS 1.1 Windows token-based agent or the AD FS 1.1 claims-aware agent that is installed with Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows Server 2008 to Windows Server 2012, perform an in-place upgrade of the operating system of the computer that hosts either agent to Windows Server 2012. For more information, see [Installing Windows Server 2012](../Topic/Installing%20Windows%20Server%202012.md). No further configuration is required.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The migrated AD FS 1.1 Windows token-based agent functions only with an AD FS 1.1 federation service that is installed with Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows Server 2008. For more information, see [Interoperating with AD FS 1.x](../Topic/Interoperating%20with%20AD%20FS%201.x.md).

> -   AD FS 2.0 federation service installed on Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows Server 2008
