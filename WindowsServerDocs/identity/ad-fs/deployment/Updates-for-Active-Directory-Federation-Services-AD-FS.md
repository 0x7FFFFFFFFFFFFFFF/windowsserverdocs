>Applies To: Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1

As of October 2016, all updates to all components of Windows Server are released only via Windows Update (WU).  There are no more hotfixes or individual downloads.
This applies to Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1.

This page lists rollup packages of particular interest for AD FS and WAP, as well as the historic list of hotfix updates recommended for AD FS and WAP.

## Updates for AD FS and WAP in Windows Server 2016
Updates for Windows Server 2016 are delivered monthly via Windows Update and are cumulative. The update package listed below is recommended for all AD FS and WAP 2016 servers and includes all previously required updates as well as the latest fixes.

|KB # |Description|Date Released
|----- | ----- |-----
|[4041688 (OS Build 14393.1794)](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/4041688)|This fix addresses an issue that intermittently misdirects AD Authority requests to the wrong Identity Provider because of incorrect caching behavior. This can effect authentication features like Multi Factor Authentication. </br></br>Added the ability for AAD Connect Health to report ADFS server health with correct fidelity (using verbose auditing) on mixed WS2012R2 and WS2016 ADFS farms.</br></br>Fixed a problem where during upgrade of 2012 R2 ADFS farm to ADFS 2016, the powershell cmdlet to raise the farm behavior level fails with a timeout when there are many relying party trusts.</br></br>Addressed an issue where AD FS causes authentication failures by modifying the wct parameter value while federating the requests to other Security Token Server (STS).|October 2017|
|[4038801 (OS Build 14393.1737)](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/4038801)|Support added for OIDC logout using federated LDPs. This will allow "Kiosk Scenarios" where multiple users might be serially logged into a single device where there is federation with an LDP.</br></br>Fixed a WinHello issue where CEP/CES based certificates don't work with gMSA accounts.</br></br>Fixes a problem where the Windows Internal Database (WID) on Windows Server 2016 ADFS servers fails to sync some settings, such as the ApplicationGroupId columns from IdentityServerPolicy.Scopes and IdentityServerPolicy.Clients tables)  due to a foreign key constraint. Such sync failures can cause different claim, claim provider and application experiences between primary to secondary ADFS servers. Also, if the WID primary role is moved to a secondary node, application groups will no longer be manageable in the ADFS management UX.</br></br>This update fixes an issues where Multi Factor Authentication does not work correctly with Mobile devices that use custom culture definitions|September 2017|

|[4034658 (OS Build 14393.1593)](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/4034658)|Fix for 2016 AD FS server in order to support MFA certificate enrollment for Windows Hello For Business for on prem deployments|August 2017|

|[4022723 (OS Build 14393.1378)](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/4022723)|[Web Application Proxy] Value of DisableHttpOnlyCookieProtection configuration property is not picked up by WAP 2016 in 2012R2/2016 mixed deployment </br></br>[Web Application Proxy] Unable to obtain user access token from AD FS in EAS Pre-auth scenarios.</br></br>AD FS 2016 : WSFED sign-out leads to an exception|June 2017
