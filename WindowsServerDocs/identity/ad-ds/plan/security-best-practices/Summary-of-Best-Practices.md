# Summary of Best Practices

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

The following table contains a summary of the best practices for securing Active Directory as described in this document, with hyperlinks to the sections in which the recommendations are detailed. Practices and controls that are described as tactical in nature may be implemented more quickly and with less effort than those that are described as strategic or are applicable to discrete components in the larger infrastructure.  

Some of the best practices described here are not specific to Active Directory, but are designed to help you implement solutions that can reduce the most commonly exploited vulnerabilities that are used to gain an initial foothold in an organization's infrastructure, which may then be used to launch attacks directly against Active Directory.  
  
Other recommendations are specific to Active Directory and may be implemented in existing AD DS installations, or implemented as fundamental principles in a new Active Directory installation, whether that installation is an enterprise deployment (housing corporate users, servers, workstations, and applications), or whether the installation is "purpose-built" (designed to house critical accounts and assets that should be separated from other AD DS forests and secured more stringently).
  
Another version of this table, which provides information about whether each best practice is tactical or strategic in nature, and whether its implementation provides preventative or detective controls can be found in the [Executive Summary](../../../ad-ds/manage/component-updates/Executive-Summary.md) section of this document. The following table provides each recommended best practice in general order of priority, and links to more information about each.
