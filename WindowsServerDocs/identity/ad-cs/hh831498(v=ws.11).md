# What is Network Device Enrollment Service for Active Directory Certificate Services?

Applies To: Windows Server (All supported versions)

The Network Device Enrollment Service (NDES) is one of the role services of Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS). Acting as a Registration Authority, NDES enables software on routers and other network devices running without domain credentials to get certificates based on the Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP).

SCEP defines the communication protocol between network devices and a Registration Authority for certificate enrollment. It strives to support the secure issuance of certificates to network devices in a scalable manner, using existing technology in closed networks with trusted endpoints. For more details on SCEP, see [Cisco Systems' Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-nourse-scep-18). For information on vulnerabilities and limitations of SCEP, see [Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) does not strongly authenticate certificate requests](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/971035).

## Understanding the Network Device Enrollment Service

As demand for secure networks, reliable authentication, and certificate issuance continues to grow, SCEP has emerged as a solution to the problem of enabling network devices that do not run with domain credentials to enroll for x509 version 3 certificates from a Certification Authority (CA). NDES provides any network device with a private key and associated certificate issued by a CA. Applications on the device can use the key and its associated certificate to interact with other entities on the network. The most common usage of an NDES-issued certificate on a network device is to authenticate the device in an IPSec session.

> [!NOTE]
> SCEP was developed to support the secure, scalable issuance of certificates to network devices by using existing certification authorities (CAs). The protocol supports CA and registration authority public key distribution, certificate enrollment, certificate revocation, certificate queries, and certificate revocation queries.

NDES performs the following functions:

1. Generates and provides one-time enrollment passwords to administrators.

2. Submits enrollment requests to the CA.

3. Retrieves enrolled certificates from the CA and forwards them to the network device.

NDES is implemented as an ISAPI extension. It requires IIS to be installed on the same computer. It does not require the CA to be installed on the same computer. The Internet Server API (ISAPI) extension runs in its own application pool, that is, SCEP. This application pool is created during setup and is configured to run with the credentials that were provided during setup. 

The SCEP specification does not require devices to support Secure Socket Layer (SSL). However, the process of retrieving a one-time password from the service should be protected using SSL. Therefore, setup will create two virtual applications - one for the device and one for the administrator.

  - [Devices communication location](https://localhost/certsrv/mscep)
  - [Administrator enrollment password retrieval location](https://localhost/certsrv/mscep_admin)

Passwords are used by the service to authenticate the device before forwarding its enrollment request to the CA. Passwords are obtained through a call to the [administration virtual application](https://localhost/certsrv/mscep_admin).

Enrolling certificates through Network Device Enrollment Service is a straighforward process:

1. Device obtains an RSA public-private key pair from /certsrv/mscep.

2. Administrator obtains a password from the Network Device Enrollment Service.

3. Administrator navigates to /certserv/mscep_admin.

4. NDES verifies administrator has required permissions for configured certificate templates.

5. Administrator sets device with  password and sets it to trust the enterprise PKI.

6. Administrator configures  device to send enrollment request to NDES.

7. NDES signs enrollment request with Enrollment Agent certificate and sends it to the CA.

8. CA issues the certificate.

9. Device retrieves  issued certificate from NDES.

## NDES configuration settings 

NDES can be configured to run as either of the following after installing the NDES binary installation files:

- A user account that is specified as a service account

- The built-in application pool identity of the Internet Information Services (IIS) computer

To learn how to configure a service account for the Network Device Enrollment Service (NDES) and how it works with certificates based on Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP), see [How to configure Network Device Enrollment Service for Active Directory Certificate Services](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/hh831498(v=ws.11))
