# Configuration Requirements
The following components are required for configuring Remote Access in the test lab:  
  
-   The product disc or files for [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_1](includes/winthreshold_server_1_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[winblue_server_1](includes/winblue_server_1_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[win8_server_1](includes/win8_server_1_md.md)].  
  
-   Five computers or virtual machines that meet the minimum hardware requirements for [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_2](includes/winthreshold_server_2_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[winblue_server_2](includes/winblue_server_2_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[win8_server_2](includes/win8_server_2_md.md)] ; one of these computers has two network adapters installed.  
  
-   The product disc or files for [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_client_1](includes/winthreshold_client_1_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[win8_client_1](includes/win8_client_1_md.md)].  
  
-   Two computers or virtual machines that meet the minimum hardware requirements for [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_client_2](includes/winthreshold_client_2_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[win8_client_2](includes/win8_client_2_md.md)]; one of these computers has two network adapters installed.  
  
-   One computer or virtual machine that meets the minimum hardware requirements for [!INCLUDE[nextref_server_7](includes/nextref_server_7_md.md)]; for the purposes of RSA this computer additionally meets the minimum memory requirements of 3GB RAM and 25GB hard disk with at least 10GB free disk space on drive C.  
  
-   Installation media or files for RSA Authentication Manager 7.1 SP4.  
  
-   License file for RSA Authentication Manager 7.1.  
  
-   Xml file with SecurID tokens initial seeds.  
  
-   Installation media or files for RSA SecurID software token.
