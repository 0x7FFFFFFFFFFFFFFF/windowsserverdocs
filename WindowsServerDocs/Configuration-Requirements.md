# Configuration Requirements
The following components are required to configure Remote Access in the test lab:  
  
-   The product disc or files for [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_1](includes/winthreshold_server_1_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[winblue_server_1](includes/winblue_server_1_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[win8_server_1](includes/win8_server_1_md.md)].  
  
-   Nine computers or virtual machines that meet the minimum hardware requirements for [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_2](includes/winthreshold_server_2_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[winblue_server_2](includes/winblue_server_2_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[win8_server_2](includes/win8_server_2_md.md)] ; three of these computers have two network adapters installed.  
  
-   The product disc or files for [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_client_1](includes/winthreshold_client_1_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[win8_client_1](includes/win8_client_1_md.md)] .  
  
-   The product disc or files for [!INCLUDE[nextref_client_7ult](includes/nextref_client_7ult_md.md)].  
  
-   Three computers or virtual machines that meet the minimum hardware requirements for  [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_client_1](includes/winthreshold_client_1_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[win8_client_2](includes/win8_client_2_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[nextref_client_7](includes/nextref_client_7_md.md)]; one of these computers has two network adapters installed.
