# Plan Remote Access with OTP Authentication
[!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_1](includes/winthreshold_server_1_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[win8_server_1](includes/win8_server_1_md.md)] combine DirectAccess and Routing and Remote Access Service \(RRAS\) VPN into a single Remote Access role. This overview provides an introduction to the configuration steps required in order to deploy a single [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_1](includes/winthreshold_server_2_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[win8_server_2](includes/win8_server_2_md.md)] Remote Access multisite deployment.  
  
  
-   [Step 1: Plan an advanced single server deployment](assetId:///2e91e90f-1ca3-402e-8f48-a2b82762cc9b). This step includes planning for the infrastructure required to deploy a single server. It includes planning for network and server settings, certificate requirements, DNS settings, network location server deployment, DirectAccess management servers, Active Directory settings, and Group Policy objects \(GPOs\).  
  
-   [Step 2: Plan the RADIUS server deployment](assetId:///913954de-8be6-4fb8-82f5-fa9c0944a959).  
  
-   [Step 3: Plan OTP certificate deployment](assetId:///15df37b5-5056-4b8f-9343-0984d59635ca).  
  
-   [Step 4: Plan for OTP on the Remote Access server](assetId:///0beff91b-3815-4438-9b0e-420704cc5510)  
  
After you have completed these planning steps, see [Configure DirectAccess with OTP authentication](assetId:///bde70218-fcef-4ff5-ac78-31319cc2ea16). For information on configuring a multisite deployment as a proof of concept in a lab environment, see [Test Lab Guide: Demonstrate DirectAccess with OTP authentication and RSA SecurID](assetId:///616db45d-f151-4abe-aecf-5f5060095a67).
