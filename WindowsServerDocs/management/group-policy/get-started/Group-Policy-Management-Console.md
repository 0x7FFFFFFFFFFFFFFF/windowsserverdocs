2.  In the main pane in **Server Manager**, click **Add roles and features**.

3.  Follow the **Add Roles and Features Wizard** until you get to the **Features** menu.

4.  Select **Group Policy Management** from the list of available features. Click **Install** and follow the steps in the wizard.

To start GPMC, do the following:

On the **Start** screen, click the **Apps** arrow. On the **Apps** screen, type**gpmc.msc**, and then click **OK** or press **ENTER**.
