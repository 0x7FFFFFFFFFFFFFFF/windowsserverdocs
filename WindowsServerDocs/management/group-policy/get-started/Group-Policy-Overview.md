# Group Policy Overview
Use this topic to find the documentation resources and other technical information you need to accomplish key Group Policy tasks. You can learn about new and updated functionality for Group Policy in  Windows Server 2012 R2  and Windows 8.1and ways to automate common Group Policy tasks by using Windows PowerShell.  
 
  
## <a name="BKMK_OVER"></a>Feature description  
Group Policy is an infrastructure that allows you to specify managed configurations for users and computers through Group Policy settings and Group Policy Preferences. To configure Group Policy settings that affect only a local computer or user, you can use the Local Group Policy Editor. You can manage Group Policy settings and Group Policy Preferences in an Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) environment through the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC). Group Policy management tools also are included in the Remote Server Administration Tools pack to provide a way for you to administer Group Policy settings from your desktop.  
  
**Windows PowerShell** When the GPMC is installed on servers or client computers, the Windows PowerShell module is also installed. You have full Windows PowerShell functionality. If you install the Remote Server Administration Tools pack, the latest Windows PowerShell cmdlets for Group Policy are also installed. For more information about Windows PowerShell cmdlets and scripts that you can use to manage Group Policy, see [Group Policy Cmdlets](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh967461.aspx).  
  
You can configure the Group Policy feature by using Windows PowerShell cmdlets. For more information about using Server Manager cmdlets to install the Group Policy Management Console, see [Install or Uninstall Roles, Role Services, or Features](../Server-Manager/Install-or-Uninstall-Roles-Role-Services-or-Features.md) and [Server Manager deployment cmdlet module](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=242610).  
  
## <a name="BKMK_APP"></a>Practical applications  
By using Group Policy, you can significantly reduce your organization’s total cost of ownership. Various factors, such as the large number of policy settings available, the interaction between multiple policies, and inheritance options, can make Group Policy design complex. By carefully planning, designing, testing, and deploying a solution based on your organization’s business requirements, you can provide the standardized functionality, security, and management control that your organization needs.
