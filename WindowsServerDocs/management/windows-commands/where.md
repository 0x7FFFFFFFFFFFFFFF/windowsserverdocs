# where
Displays the location of files that match the given search pattern.  
  
for examples of how to use this command, see [Examples](#BKMK_examples).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
where [/r <dir>] [/q] [/f] [/t] [$<ENV>:|<path>:]<Pattern>[ ...]   
```  
  
## Parameters  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|-------------|---------------|  
|\/r <dir>|Indicates a recursive search, starting with the specified directory.|  
|\/q|Returns an exit code \(**0** for success, **1** for failure\) without displaying the list of matched files.|  
|\/f|Displays the results of the **where** command in quotation marks.|  
|\/t|Displays the file size and the last modified date and time of each matched file.|  
|\[$<ENV>:&#124;<path>:\]<Pattern>\[ ...\]|Specifies the search pattern for the files to match. at least one pattern is required, and the pattern can include wildcard characters \(**\*** and **?**\). By default, **where** searches the current directory and the paths that are specified in the path environment variable. You can specify a different path to search by using the format $*ENV*:*Pattern* \(where *ENV* is an existing environment variable containing one or more paths\) or by using the format *path*:*Pattern* \(where *path* is the directory path you want to search\). These optional formats should not be used with the **\/r** command\-line option.|  
|\/?|Displays help at the command prompt.|  
  
## remarks  
  
-   if you do not specify a file name extension, the extensions listed in the pathEXT environment variable are appended to the pattern by default.  
  
-   **Where** can run recursive searches, display file information such as date or size, and accept environment variables in place of paths on local computers.
