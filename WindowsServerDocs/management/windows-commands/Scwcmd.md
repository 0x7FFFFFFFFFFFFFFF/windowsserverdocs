# scwcmd
The scwcmd.exe command line\-tool included with the Security Configuration Wizard \(SCW\) can be used to perform the following tasks:

-   Configure one or many servers with an SCW\-generated policy.

-   Analyze one or many servers with an SCW\-generated policy.

-   View analysis results in HTML format.

-   Roll back SCW policies.

-   Transform an SCW\-generated policy into native files that are supported by Group Policy.

-   register a Security Configuration Database extension with SCW.

When you use **scwcmd** to configure, analyze, or roll back a policy on a remote server, SCW must be installed on the remote server.
