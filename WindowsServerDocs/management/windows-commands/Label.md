# label
creates, changes, or deletes the volume label \(that is, the name\) of a disk. if used without parameters, the **label** command changes the current volume label or deletes the existing label.

for examples of how to use this command, see [Examples](#BKMK_examples).

## Syntax

```
label [/mp] [<volume>] [<label>]
```

## Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|-------------|---------------|
|\/mp|Specifies that the volume should be treated as a mount point or volume name.|
|<volume>|Specifies a drive letter \(followed by a colon\), mount point, or volume name. if a volume name is specified, the **\/mp** parameter is unnecessary.|
|<label>|Specifies the label for the volume.|
|\/?|Displays help at the command prompt.|

## remarks

-   Windows displays the volume label and serial number \(if it has one\) as part of the directory listing.

-   An NTFS volume label can be up to 32 characters in length, including spaces. NTFS volume labels retain and display the case that was used when the label was created.

-   if you do not specify a value for the **label** parameter, the **label** command displays output in the following format:

    ```
    volume in drive C: xxxxxxxxxxx 
    volume Serial Number is xxxx-xxxx 
    volume label (32 characters, ENTER for none)?
    ```

    You can type a new volume label or press ENTER to keep the current label. if you press ENTER and the volume currently has a label, the **label** command prompts you with the following message:

    ```
    delete current volume label (Y/N)?
    ```

    Press Y to delete the label, or press N to keep the label.
