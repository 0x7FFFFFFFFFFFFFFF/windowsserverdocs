# recover

>Applies To: Windows Server&reg; 2016, Windows Server&reg; 2012 R2, Windows Server&reg; 2012

recovers readable information from a bad or defective disk.
for examples of how to use this command, see [Examples](#BKMK_examples).
## Syntax
```
recover [<Drive>:][<path>]<FileName>
```
## Parameters
|Parameter|Description|
|-------|--------|
|[<Drive>:][<path>]<FileName>|Specifies the location and name of the file that you want to recover. *FileName* is required.|
|/?|Displays help at the command prompt.|
## remarks
-   The **recover** command reads a file, sector-by-sector, and recovers data from the good sectors. Data in bad sectors is lost.
-   Bad sectors reported by **chkdsk** were marked as "bad" when your disk was prepared for operation. They pose no danger, and **recover** does not affect them.
-   Because all data in bad sectors is lost when you recover a file, you should recover only one file at a time.
-   You cannot use wildcard characters (**\*** and **?**) with the **recover** command. You must specify a file (and the location of the file if it is not in the current directory).
