# Change port

>Applies To: Windows Server&reg; 2016, Windows Server&reg; 2012 R2, Windows Server&reg; 2012

Lists or changes the COM port mappings to be compatible with MS-DOS applications.
For examples of how to use this command, see [Examples](#BKMK_examples).
> [!NOTE]
> In Windows Server 2008 R2, Terminal Services was renamed Remote Desktop Services. To find out what's new in the latest version, see [Whatâ€™s New in Remote Desktop Services in Windows Server 2012](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh831527) in the Windows Server TechNet Library.
## Syntax
```
change port [<PortX>=<PortY> | /d <PortX> | /query]
```
## Parameters
|Parameter|Description|
|-------------|---------------|
|<PortX>=<PortY>|Maps COM <*PortX*> to <*PortY*>.|
|/d <PortX>|Deletes the mapping for COM <*PortX*>.|
|/query|Displays the current port mappings.|
|/?|Displays help at the command prompt.|
## Remarks
-   Most MS-DOS applications support only COM1 through COM4 serial ports. The **change port** command maps a serial port to a different port number, allowing applications that do not support high-numbered COM ports to access the serial port. Remapping works only for the current session and is not retained if you log off from a session and then log on again.
-   Use **change port** without any parameters to display the available COM ports and their current mappings.
## <a name="BKMK_examples"></a>Examples
-   To map COM12 to COM1 for use by an MS-DOS-based application, type:
    ```
    change port com12=com1
    ```
-   To display the current port mappings, type:
    ```
    change port /query
    ```
