> [!NOTE]
> In Windows Server 2008 R2, Terminal Services was renamed remote Desktop Services. To find out what's new in the latest version, see [Whatâ€™s New in remote Desktop Services in Windows Server 2012](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh831527) in the Windows Server TechNet Library.

## Syntax

```
tskill {<ProcessID> | <ProcessName>} [/server:<ServerName>] [/id:<SessionID> | /a] [/v]
```

## Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|-------------|---------------|
|<ProcessID>|Specifies the ID of the process that you want to end.|
|<ProcessName>|Specifies the name of the process that you want to end. This parameter can include wildcard characters.|
|\/server:<ServerName>|Specifies the terminal server that contains the process that you want to end. if **\/server** is not specified, the current rd Session Host server is used.|

## remarks

-   You can use **tskill** to end only those processes that belong to you, unless you are an administrator. Administrators have full access to all **tskill** functions and can end processes that are running in other user sessions.

-   When all processes that are running in a session end, the session also ends.

-   if you use the *ProcessName* and the **\/server:***ServerName* parameters, you must also specify either the **\/id:***SessionID* or the **\/a** parameter.
