## Syntax
```
wbadmin start systemstatebackup
-backupTarget:<volumeName>
[-quiet]
```
## Parameters
|Parameter|Description|
|-------|--------|
|-backupTarget|Specifies the location where you want to store the backup. The storage location requires a drive letter or a GUID-based volume of the format: \\\\?\volume{*GUID*}.<br /><br />A system state backup to a shared network folder is not supported on a computer running Windows Server 2008. if your server is running Windows Server 2008 R2 or later you can use the command **-backuptarget:\\\servername\sharedFolder\\** to store system state backups.|
|-quiet|Runs the subcommand with no prompts to the user.|
