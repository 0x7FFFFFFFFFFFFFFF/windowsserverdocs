# type
Displays the contents of a text file. Use the **type** command to view a text file without modifying it.

for examples of how to use this command, see [Examples](#BKMK_examples).

## Syntax

```
type [<Drive>:][<path>]<FileName>
```

## Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|-------------|---------------|
|\[<Drive>:\]\[<path>\]<FileName>|Specifies the location and name of the file or files that you want to view. Separate multiple file names with spaces.|
|\/?|Displays help at the command prompt.|

## remarks

-   if *FileName* contains spaces, enclose it in quotation marks \(for example, "FileÂ Name Containing Spaces.txt"\).

-   if you display a binary file or a file that is created by a program, you may see strange characters on the screen, including formfeed characters and escape\-sequence symbols. These characters represent control codes that are used in the binary file. In general, avoid using the **type** command to display binary files.
