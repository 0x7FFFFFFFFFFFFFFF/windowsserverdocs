Displays the contents of a text file. Use the **type** command to view a text file without modifying it.
for examples of how to use this command, see [Examples](#BKMK_examples).
## Syntax
```
type [<Drive>:][<path>]<FileName>
```
## Parameters
|Parameter|Description|
|-------|--------|
|[<Drive>:][<path>]<FileName>|Specifies the location and name of the file or files that you want to view. Separate multiple file names with spaces.|
|/?|Displays help at the command prompt.|
## remarks
-   if *FileName* contains spaces, enclose it in quotation marks (for example, "File Name Containing Spaces.txt").
-   if you display a binary file or a file that is created by a program, you may see strange characters on the screen, including formfeed characters and escape-sequence symbols. These characters represent control codes that are used in the binary file. In general, avoid using the **type** command to display binary files.
