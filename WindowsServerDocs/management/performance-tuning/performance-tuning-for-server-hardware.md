# Performance Tuning for Server Hardware


You should select the proper hardware to meet your expected performance and power goals. Hardware bottlenecks limit the effectiveness of software tuning. This section provides guidelines for hardware to provide a good foundation for the role that a server will play.

**Note**  
There is a tradeoff between power and performance when choosing hardware. For example, faster processors and more disks will yield better performance, but they can also consume more energy. For more info about these tradeoffs, see [Server Hardware Power Considerations](server-hardware-power-considerations.md) in this section.

For more performance tuning guidelines, see [Performance Tuning Guidelines for Windows Server 2012 R2](performance-tuning-guidelines-for-windows-server-2012-r2.md).
