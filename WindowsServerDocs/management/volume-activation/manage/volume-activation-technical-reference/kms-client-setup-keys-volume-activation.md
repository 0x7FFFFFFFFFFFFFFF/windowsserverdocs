# KMS Client Setup Keys for volume Activation
By default, the  Windows 7  and  Windows Server 2008 R2  and later operating systems use KMS for activation. In volume installations, the setup key is installed by default, which makes the system a KMS client. if you are converting a computer from a KMS host, MAK, or retail edition of Windows to a KMS client, install the applicable setup key \(GVLK\) from [appendix A: KMS Client Setup Keys](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj612867.aspx) by using **slmgr \/ipk <setup key>**.
