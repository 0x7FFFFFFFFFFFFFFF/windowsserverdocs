# Appendixes - Additional guarded fabric configuration options

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016

The following appendixes provide configuration options for guarded fabrics that supplement the options described in [Setting up the Host Guardian Service - HGS](guarded-fabric-setting-up-the-host-guardian-service-hgs.md).

| Option | Appendix |
|--------|----------|
| Create and configure Nano servers to be TPM trusted guarded hosts  | [Appendix A - Configure Nano server as TPM attested guarded host](guarded-fabric-configure-nano-server-as-tpm-guarded-host.md) |
| Add HGS to an existing domain, rather than using the default process of allowing HGS to create its own forest and domain  | [Appendix B - Add HGS to an existing domain](guarded-fabric-add-hgs-to-an-existing-domain.md)|
