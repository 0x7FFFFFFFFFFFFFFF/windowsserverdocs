# AppLocker Policies Design Guide
This topic for the IT professional introduces the design and planning steps required to deploy application control policies by using AppLocker which was introduced in  Windows Server® 2008 R2  and  Windows 7® .

## Purpose of this guide
This guide provides important designing and planning information for deploying application control policies by using AppLocker. It is intended for security architects, security administrators, and system administrators. Through a sequential and iterative process, you can create an AppLocker policy deployment plan for your organization that will address your specific application control requirements by department, organizational unit, or business group.

This guide does not cover the deployment of application control policies by using Software Restriction Policies \(SRP\). However, SRP is discussed as a deployment option in conjunction with AppLocker policies. For information about these options, see [Determine Your Application Control Objectives]().

To understand if AppLocker is the correct application control solution for your organization, see [Understand AppLocker Policy Design Decisions]().
