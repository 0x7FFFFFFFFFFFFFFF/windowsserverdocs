# Create Your AppLocker Planning Document

>Applies To: Windows Server&reg; 2016, Windows Server&reg; 2012 R2, Windows Server&reg; 2012

This planning topic for the IT professional summarizes the information you need to research and include in your AppLocker planning document.

## The AppLocker deployment design
The design process and the planning document help you investigate application usage in your organization and record your findings so you can effectively deploy and maintain application control policies by using AppLocker.

You should have completed these steps in the design and planning process:

1.  [Determine Your Application Control Objectives](determine-your-application-control-objectives.md)

2.  [Create List of Applications Deployed to Each Business Group](create-list-of-applications-deployed-to-each-business-group.md)

3.  [Select Types of Rules to Create](select-types-of-rules-to-create.md)

4.  [Determine Group Policy Structure and Rule Enforcement](determine-group-policy-structure-and-rule-enforcement.md)

5.  [Plan for AppLocker Policy Management](plan-for-applocker-policy-management.md)

### AppLocker planning document contents
Your planning document should contain:

-   A list of business groups that will participate in the application control policy project, their requirements, a description of their business processes, and contact information.

-   Application control policy project target dates, both for planning and deployment.

-   A complete list of applications used by each business group (or organizational unit), including version information and installation paths.

-   What condition to apply to rules governing each application (or whether to use the default set provided by AppLocker).

-   A strategy for using Group Policy to deploy the AppLocker policies.

-   A strategy in processing the application usage events generated by AppLocker.

-   A strategy to maintain and manage AppLocker polices after deployment.

### Sample template for an AppLocker planning document
You can use the following form to construct your own AppLocker planning document.

**Business group**:

**Operating system environment**: (Windows and non-Windows)

|**Other departments**|In this business group:|Affected by this project:|
|**Security policies**|Internal:|Regulatory/compliance:|
|**Business goals**|Primary:|Secondary:|
|**Project target dates**|Design signoff date:|Policy deployment date:|

**Rules**

**Event processing**
