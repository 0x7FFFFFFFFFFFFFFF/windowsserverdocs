# Understand the applocker Policy Deployment Process
This planning and deployment topic for the IT professional describes the process for using applocker when deploying application control policies.

To successfully deploy applocker policies, you need to identify your application control objectives and construct the policies for those objectives. The key to the process is taking an accurate inventory of your organization's applications, which requires investigation of all the targeted business groups. With an accurate inventory, you can create rules and set enforcement criteria that will allow the organization to use the required applications and allow the IT department to manage a controlled set of applications.

The following diagram shows the main points in the design, planning, and deployment process for applocker.
