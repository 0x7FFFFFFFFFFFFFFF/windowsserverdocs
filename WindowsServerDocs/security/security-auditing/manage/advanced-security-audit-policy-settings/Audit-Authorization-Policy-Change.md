# Audit Authorization Policy Change
This topic for the IT professional describes the Advanced Security Audit policy setting, **Audit Authorization Policy Change**, which determines whether the operating system generates audit events when specific changes are made to the authorization policy.

Authorization policy changes that can be audited include:

-   Assigning or removing user rights \(privileges\) such as **SeCreateTokenPrivilege**, except for the system access rights that are audited by using the [Audit Authentication Policy Change](Audit-Authentication-Policy-Change.md) subcategory.

-   Changing the Encrypting File System \(EFS\) policy.

Event volume: Low

Default: Not configured

If this policy setting is configured, the following events appear on computers running the supported versions of the Windows operating system as designated in the **Applies to** list at the beginning of this topic, in addition to Windows ServerÂ 2008 and Windows Vista.

|Event ID|Event message|
|------------|-----------------|
|4704|A user right was assigned.|
|4705|A user right was removed.|
|4706|A new trust was created to a domain.|
|4707|A trust to a domain was removed.|
|4714|Encrypted data recovery policy was changed.|
