# Registry (Global Object Access Auditing)
This topic for the IT professional describes the Advanced Security Audit policy setting, **Registry \(Global Object Access Auditing\)**, which enables you to configure a global system access control list \(SACL\) on the registry of a computer.

If you select the **Configure security** check box on this policyâ€™s property page, you can add a user or group to the global SACL. This enables you to define computer system access control lists \(SACLs\) per object type for the registry. The specified SACL is then automatically applied to every registry object type.

This policy setting must be used in combination with the **Registry** security policy setting under Object Access. For more information, see [Audit Registry](Audit-Registry.md).

This policy setting is available on computers running the supported versions of the Windows operating system as designated in the **Applies to** list at the beginning of this topic.
