# Audit RPC Events
This topic for the IT professional describes the Advanced Security Audit policy setting, **Audit RPC Events**, which determines whether the operating system generates audit events when inbound remote procedure call \(RPC\) connections are made.

RPC is a technology for creating distributed client\/server programs. RPC is an interprocess communication technique that enables client and server software to communicate. For more information, see [What Is RPC?](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc787851(v=WS.10).aspx).

Event volume: High on RPC servers

Default: Not configured

If this policy setting is configured, the following event appears on computers running the supported versions of the Windows operating system as designated in the **Applies To** list at the beginning of this topic, in addition to Windows ServerÂ 2008 and Windows Vista.

|Event ID|Event message|
|------------|-----------------|
|5712|A Remote Procedure Call \(RPC\) was attempted.|
