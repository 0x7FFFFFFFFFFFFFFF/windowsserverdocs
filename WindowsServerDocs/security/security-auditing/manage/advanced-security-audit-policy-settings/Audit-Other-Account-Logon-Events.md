# Audit Other Account Logon Events
This topic for the IT professional describes the advanced security audit policy setting, **Audit Other Account Logon Events**, which allows you to audit events generated by responses to credential requests submitted for a user account logon that are not credential validation or Kerberos tickets.

Examples can include the following:

-   Remote Desktop session disconnections

-   New Remote Desktop sessions

-   Locking and unlocking a workstation

-   Invoking a screen saver

-   Dismissing a screen saver

-   Detection of a Kerberos replay attack, in which a Kerberos request with identical information was received twice

    > [!NOTE]
    > This condition could be caused by a network misconfiguration.

-   Access to a wireless network granted to a user or computer account

-   Access to a wired 802.1x network granted to a user or computer account

Event volume: Varies, depending on system use

Default: Not configured

If this policy setting is configured, the following events appear on computers running the supported versions of Windows as designated in the **Applies To** list at the beginning of this topic, in addition to Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista.
