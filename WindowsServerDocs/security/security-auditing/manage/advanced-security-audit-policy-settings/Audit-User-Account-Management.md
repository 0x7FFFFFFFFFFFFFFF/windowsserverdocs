# Audit User Account Management
This topic for the IT professional describes the Advanced Security Audit policy setting, **Audit User Account Management**, which determines whether the operating system generates audit events when specific user account management tasks are performed.

Tasks that are audited for user account management include:

-   A user account is created, changed, deleted, renamed, disabled, enabled, locked out, or unlocked.

-   A user account password is set or changed.

-   Security identifier \(SID\) history is added to a user account.

-   The Directory Services Restore Mode password is set.

-   Permissions are changed on accounts that are members of administrator groups.

-   Credential Manager credentials are backed up or restored.

This policy setting is essential for tracking events that involve provisioning and managing user accounts.

Event volume: Low

Default: Success

If this policy setting is configured, the following events appear on computers running the supported versions of the Windows operating system as designated in the **Applies To** list at the beginning of this topic, in addition to Windows ServerÂ 2008 and Windows Vista.
