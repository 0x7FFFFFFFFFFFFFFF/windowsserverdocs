# Audit Handle Manipulation
This topic for the IT professional describes the Advanced Security Audit policy setting, **Audit Handle Manipulation**, which determines whether the operating system generates audit events when a handle to an object is opened or closed.

Only objects with configured system access control lists \(SACLs\) generate these events, and only if the attempted handle operation matches the SACL.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Handle Manipulation events are generated only for object types where the corresponding File System or Registry Object Access subcategory is enabled. For more information, see [Audit File System](Audit-File-System.md) or [Audit Registry](Audit-Registry.md).

Event volume: High, depending on how SACLs are configured

Default: Not configured

If this policy setting is configured, the following events appear on computers running the supported versions of the Windows operating system as designated in the **Applies to** list at the beginning of this topic, in addition to Windows ServerÂ 2008 and Windows Vista.

|Event ID|Event message|
|------------|-----------------|
|4656|A handle to an object was requested.|
|4658|The handle to an object was closed.|
|4690|An attempt was made to duplicate a handle to an object.|
