# Audit Other Logon - Logoff Events
This topic for the IT professional describes the Advanced Security Audit policy setting, **Audit Other Logon\/Logoff Events**, which determines whether Windows generates audit events for other logon or logoff events.

These other logon or logoff events include:

-   A Remote Desktop session connects or disconnects.

-   A workstation is locked or unlocked.

-   A screen saver is invoked or dismissed.

-   A replay attack is detected. This event indicates that a Kerberos request was received twice with identical information. This condition could also be caused by network misconfiguration.

-   A user is granted access to a wireless network. It can either be a user account or the computer account.

-   A user is granted access to a wired 802.1x network. It can either be a user account or the computer account.

Logon events are essential to understanding user activity and detecting potential attacks.

Event volume: Low

Default: Not configured

If this policy setting is configured, the following events appear on computers running the supported versions of Windows as designated in the **Applies To** list at the beginning of this topic, in addition to Windows ServerÂ 2008 and Windows Vista.
