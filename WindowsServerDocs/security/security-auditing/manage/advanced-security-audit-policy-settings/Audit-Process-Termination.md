# Audit Process Termination
This topic for the IT professional describes the Advanced Security Audit policy setting, **Audit Process Termination**, which determines whether the operating system generates audit events when an attempt is made to end a process.

Success audits record successful attempts and Failure audits record unsuccessful attempts.

If you do not configure this policy setting, no audit event is generated when a process ends.

This policy setting can help you track user activity and understand how the computer is used.

Event volume: Varies, depending on how the computer is used

Default: Not configured

If this policy setting is configured, the following event appears on computers running the supported versions of the Windows operating system as designated in the **Applies To** list at the beginning of this topic, in addition to Windows ServerÂ 2008 and Windows Vista.

|Event ID|Event message|
|------------|-----------------|
|4689|A process has exited.|
