## <a name="BKMK_Examples"></a>Examples  
The following example displays the drives on the computer and identifies whether or not they are BitLocker\-protected and the current encryption status.  
  
```  
managebde -status  
```  
  
The following example illustrates enabling BitLocker on drive C with the option of a recovery password. The recovery password will be generated by BitLocker and displayed on the screen so that you can record it.  
  
```  
managebde –on C: -recoverypassword  
```  
  
The following example illustrates unlocking a BitLocker\-protected drive by using a recovery password.  
  
```  
managebde –unlock E: -recoverypassword 111111-222222-333333-444444-555555-666666-777777-888888
