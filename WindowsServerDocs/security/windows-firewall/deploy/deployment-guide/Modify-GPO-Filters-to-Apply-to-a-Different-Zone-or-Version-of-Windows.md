# Modify GPO Filters to Apply to a Different Zone or Version of Windows
You must reconfigure your copied GPO so that it contains the correct security group and WMI filters for its new role. If you are creating the GPO for the isolated domain, use the [Block members of a group from applying a GPO](#bkmk_TopreventmembersofgroupfromapplyingaGPO) procedure to prevent members of the boundary and encryption zones from incorrectly applying the GPOs for the main isolated domain.

**Administrative credentials**

To complete these procedures, you must be a member of the Domain Administrators group, or otherwise be delegated permissions to modify the GPOs.
