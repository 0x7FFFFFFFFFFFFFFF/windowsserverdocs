# Open the Group Policy Management Console to IP Security Policies

### To open a GPO to the IP Security Policies section

1.  On a computer that has the Group Policy Management feature installed, click the **Start** charm, and then click the **Group Policy Management** tile.

2.  In the navigation pane, expand **Forest:** *YourForestName*, expand **Domains**, expand *YourDomainName*, expand **Group Policy Objects**, right\-click the GPO you want to modify, and then click **Edit**.

3.  In the navigation pane of the Group Policy Management Editor, expand **Computer Configuration**, expand **Policies**, expand **Windows Settings**, expand **Security Settings**, and then click **IP Security Policies on Active Directory \(***YourDomainName***\)**.
