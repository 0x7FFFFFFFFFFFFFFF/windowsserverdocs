# Documenting the Zones
Generally, the task of determining zone membership is not complex, but it can be time\-consuming. Use the information generated during the [Designing a Windows Firewall with Advanced Security Strategy](Designing-a-Windows-Firewall-with-Advanced-Security-Strategy.md) section of this guide to determine the zone in which to put each host. You can document this zone placement by adding a Group column to the inventory table shown in the [Designing a Windows Firewall with Advanced Security Strategy](Designing-a-Windows-Firewall-with-Advanced-Security-Strategy.md) section. A sample is shown here:

|Host name|Hardware reqs met|Software reqs met|Configuration required|Details|Projected cost|Group|
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------|------------------|---------|
|CLIENT001|No|No|Upgrade hardware and software.|Current operating system is WindowsÂ XP. Old hardware not compatible with [!INCLUDE[win8_client_2](includes/win8_client_2_md.md)].|$??|Isolated domain|
|SERVER002|Yes|No|Join trusted domain, upgrade from [!INCLUDE[nextref_longhorn](includes/nextref_longhorn_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[win8_server_2](includes/win8_server_2_md.md)]|No antivirus software present.|$??|Encryption|
|SENSITIVE001|Yes|Yes|Not required.|Running [!INCLUDE[win8_server_2](includes/win8_server_2_md.md)]. Ready for inclusion.|$0|Isolated server \(in zone by itself\)|
|PRINTSVR1|Yes|Yes|Not required.|Running [!INCLUDE[nextref_server_7](includes/nextref_server_7_md.md)]. Ready for inclusion.|$0|Boundary|
