## <a name="BKMK_OVER"></a>Feature description
Smart cards are a tamper\-resistant and portable way to provide security solutions for tasks such as client authentication, logging on to domains, code signing, and securing e\-mail.

## <a name="BKMK_APP"></a>Practical applications
Smart cards and their associated personal identification numbers \(PINs\) are an increasingly popular, reliable, and cost\-effective form of two\-factor authentication. With the right controls in place, the user must have the smart card and know the PIN to gain access to network resources. The two\-factor requirement significantly reduces the likelihood of unauthorized access to an organization???s network. Smart cards provide particularly effective security control in two scenarios: to secure administrator accounts and to secure remote access.
