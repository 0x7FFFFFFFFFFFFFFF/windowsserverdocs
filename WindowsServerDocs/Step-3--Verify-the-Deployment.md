# Step 3: Verify the Deployment
This topic describes how to verify that you have correctly configured your DirectAccess deployment.  
  
### To verify access to internal resources through DirectAccess  
  
1.  Connect a DirectAccess client computer to the corporate network and obtain the Group Policy Object.  
  
2.  Click the **Network connections** icon in the notification area to access the DirectAcess Media Manager.  
  
3.  Click **DirectAccess Connection**, and you will see that the status is **Connected Locally**.  
  
4.  Connect the client computer to the external network and attempt to access internal resources.  
  
    You should be able to access all corporate resources.
