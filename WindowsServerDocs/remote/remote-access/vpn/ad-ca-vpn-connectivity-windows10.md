# Conditional access for VPN connectivity using Azure AD

With [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) conditional access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-azure-portal), you can fine-tune how authorized users access your resources. With Azure AD conditional access for virtual private network (VPN) connectivity, you can help protect your VPN connections.
