# Deploy a Remote Desktop Services infrastructure

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016

There are multiple ways to deploy Remote Desktop Services. You can create a solution that is completely on-premises, using Windows Server roles and features, a solution that leverages Azure infrastructure to provide a hosting solution, or a hybrid solution that combines the best of both.   
  
Use the following information to create your basic deployment:  
1.  [Configure your environment](Configure-your-desktop-hosting-environment.md).  
4.  [Deploy Remote Desktop Services](Deploy-your-Remote-Desktop-environment.md).  
5. [Validate and secure your deployment](Validate-and-secure-your-Remote-Desktop-deployment.md).
