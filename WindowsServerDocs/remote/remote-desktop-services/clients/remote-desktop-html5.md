# Getting started with the Remote Desktop web client

* For the web client, you'll need a client desktop machine running Windows, Mac, or Linux.
* Mobile devices are not supported at this time.
* The client currently supports Edge, IE 11, Google Chrome, and Safari. Firefox support is still in progress.

## What is the Remote Desktop web client?

The Remote Desktop client lets you access your organization's remote desktop workstation through your internet browser. You'll be able to interact with apps on your remote machine like you would with a local computer no matter where you are, without having to switch to a different desktop machine. Once your admin sets up your Remote Desktop group, all you need is your username, domain, password, and a supported web browser, and you're good to go.

## Start using the Remote Desktop client

To sign in to the client, open your web browser and navigate to the Work Resources URL that your admin set up. At the sign in page, enter your domain and user name in the format ```DOMAIN\username```, enter your password, and then select **Sign in**.

>[!NOTE]
>By signing in to the web client, you agree that your computer complies with your organization's securty policy.

After you sign in, the client will take you to the **Resources** page. Under the **Work Resources** menu, you'll see several icons for the apps the admin has made available to the work group. To start using an app, select the icon for the app you want to use, enter the same user name and password you used to log in to the web client when prompted, and then select **Connect**. Wait for the remote desktop to load, and then start using the app as you would normally.

When you're finished with your session, select the **Sign Out** button in the upper-right corner on the **Options** toolbar.

>[!NOTE]
>Your Remote Desktop web client session will automatically time out after a period of inactivity. If your session ends before you're ready due to timing out, just refresh your browser and sign in again.
