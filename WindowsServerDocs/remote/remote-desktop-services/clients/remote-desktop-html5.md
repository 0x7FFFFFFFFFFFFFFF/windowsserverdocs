# Getting started with the Remote Desktop web client

* For the web client, you'll need a client desktop machine running Windows, Mac, or Linux.
* Mobile devices are not supported at this time.
* The client currently supports Edge, IE 11, Google Chrome, and Safari. Firefox support is still in progress.

## Start using the Remote Desktop client

To sign in to the client, enter your domain and user name in the format ```Domain\user name```, enter your password, and then select **Sign in**.

>[!NOTE]
>By signing in to the web client, you agree that your computer complies with your organization's securty policy.

After you sign in, the client will take you to the **Resources** page. Under the **Work Resources** menu, you'll see several icons for the apps the admin has made available to the work group. To start using an app, select the icon for the app you want to use, enter your username and password when prompted, and then select **Connect**.

When you're finished with your session, select the **Sign Out** button in the upper right-hand corner.
