# Connecting Windows Server to Azure hybrid services

>Applies to: Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016

You can extend on-premises deployments of Windows Server to the cloud by using Azure hybrid services. These cloud services provide an array of useful functions, including the following:

- Protect virtual machines and use cloud-based backup and disaster recovery (HA/DR) with Azure Site Recovery. 
- Track whatâ€™s happening across your applications, network and infrastructure with the help of advanced analytics and machine learning in Azure Monitor. 
- Simplify network connectivity to Azure with Azure Network Adapter.
- Keep virtual machines up to date with Azure Update Management.

Azure hybrid services work with Windows Servers in a number of configurations:

- Virtual machines (VMs)
- Stand-alone physical servers
- Clusters, including hyper-converged clusters, Azure Stack HCI, and Windows Server Software-Defined (WSSD)
