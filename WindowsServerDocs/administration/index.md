## [Microsoft Server Performance Advisor](server-performance-advisor/microsoft-server-performance-advisor.md)

With Microsoft Server Performance Advisor (SPA), you can collect metrics to diagnose performance issues on Windows servers unobtrusively without adding software agents or reconfiguring production servers. SPA generates comprehensive performance reports and historical charts with recommendations.

## [Server Manager](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt126175.aspx)

The content in this section describes how to use Server Manager in Windows Server to manage both local and remote Windows-based servers from desktop computers.  

## [Software Inventoy Logging (SIL)](software-inventory-logging/get-started-with-software-inventory-logging.md)

Software Inventory Logging in Windows Server is a feature with a simple set of PowerShell cmdlets that help server administrators retrieve a list of the Microsoft software that is installed on their servers. It also provides the capability to collect and forward this data periodically over the network to a target web server, using the HTTPS protocol, for aggregation. Managing the feature, primarily for hourly collection and forwarding, is also done with PowerShell commands.

## [User Access Logging (UAL)](user-access-logging/get-started-with-user-access-logging.md)

User Access Logging aggregates unique client device and user request events that are logged on a computer running Windows Server 2012 or 2016 into a local database. These records are then made available (through a query by a server administrator) to retrieve quantities and instances by server role, by user, by device, by the local server, and by date. In addition, UAL also enables non-Microsoft software developers to instrument their UAL events to be aggregated. 

## [Windows Server Update Services &#40;WSUS&#41;](windows-server-update-services/get-started/windows-server-update-services-wsus.md)  
The content in this section describes how to configure and manage WSUS. In this section you will find information about installing the WSUS Server Role, configuring WSUS servers, as well as managing updates, and managing WSUS client computers and WSUS computer groups.

## [Windows Commands](windows-commands/windows-commands.md)

The Windows command-line tools are used to perform administrative tasks in Windows. You can use the command reference to familiarize yourself with the command-line tools, to learn about the command shell, and to automate command-line tasks by using batch files or scripting tools.
