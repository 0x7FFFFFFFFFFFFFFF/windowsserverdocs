# Better together Windows Server and Azure Management

Windows Server together with Microsoft Azure cloud management capabilities allows you to get even more out of your Windows Server investments.

## Cloud operations for Windows Server in a hybrid and multicloud environment

When you connect your machine to Azure, it enables the ability for you to perform the following operational functions as described in the following table.

|Operations function |Description | 
|--------------------|------------|
|**Govern** ||
| Azure Policy |Assign [Azure Policy guest configurations](../../governance/policy/concepts/guest-configuration.md) to audit settings inside the machine. To understand the cost of using Azure Policy Guest Configuration policies with Arc-enabled servers, see Azure Policy [pricing guide](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-policy/)|
| Azure Tags |Use [tags](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources) to organize your Windows Servers and Azure resources and management hierarchy|
|**Protect** ||
| Microsoft Defender for Cloud | Protect non-Azure servers with [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint), included through [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](../../security-center/defender-for-servers-introduction.md), for threat detection, for vulnerability management, and to proactively monitor for potential security threats. Microsoft Defender for Cloud presents the alerts and remediation suggestions from the threats detected. |
| Microsoft Sentinel | Machines connected to Arc-enabled servers can be [configured with Microsoft Sentinel](scenario-onboard-azure-sentinel.md) to collect security-related events and correlate them with other data sources. |
| Azure Backup| Backup |
| Azure Site Recovery| DR |
|**Configure** ||
| Azure Automation |Automate frequent and time-consuming management tasks using PowerShell and Python [runbooks](../../automation/automation-runbook-execution.md).<br> Assess configuration changes about installed software, Microsoft services, Windows registry and files, and Linux daemons using [Change Tracking and Inventory](../../automation/change-tracking/overview.md).<br> Use [Update Management](../../automation/update-management/overview.md) to manage operating system updates for your Windows and Linux servers. |
| Azure Automanage (preview) | Automate onboarding and configuration of a set of Azure services when you use [Automanage Machine for Arc-enabled servers](../../automanage/automanage-arc.md).|
| VM extensions | Provides post-deployment configuration and automation tasks using supported [Arc-enabled servers VM extensions](manage-vm-extensions.md) for your non-Azure Windows or Linux machine. |
|**Monitor**|
| Azure Monitor | Monitor the connected machine guest operating system performance, and discover application components to monitor their processes and dependencies with other resources using [VM insights](../../azure-monitor/vm/vminsights-overview.md). Collect other log data, such as performance data and events, from the operating system or workload(s) running on the machine with the [Log Analytics agent](../../azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview.md#log-analytics-agent). This data is stored in a [Log Analytics workspace](../../azure-monitor/logs/design-logs-deployment.md). |
|**Extend and connect**|
| Azure Active Directory | Azure AD + Managed Identity |
| Azure Extended Network | . |
| Azure Network Adapter | . |
| Azure File Sync | . |
| Storage Replica | . |
