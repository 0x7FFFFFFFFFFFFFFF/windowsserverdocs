# Install and Configure Advanced DirectAccess
This overview lists the configuration steps required to deploy a single DirectAccess server running [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_1](includes/winthreshold_server_1_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[winblue_server_1](includes/winblue_server_1_md.md)], or [!INCLUDE[win8_server_1](includes/win8_server_1_md.md)] with IPv4 and IPv6.

-   [Step 1: Configuring DirectAccess Infrastructure](Step-1--Configuring-DirectAccess-Infrastructure.md).

    In this phase, you configure network and server settings, certificate requirements, Domain Name System \(DNS\) settings, the network location server deployment, DirectAccess management servers, Active Directory settings, and Group Policy Objects \(GPOs\).

-   [Step 2: Configuring DirectAccess Servers](Step-2--Configuring-DirectAccess-Servers.md).

    In this phase, you configure the DirectAccess client computers, server settings, infrastructure servers, and application servers.

-   [Step 3: Verify the Deployment](Step-3--Verify-the-Deployment.md).

    This step describes steps for verifying the deployment.

Before you start your deployment, verify the planning steps that are described in [Plan an Advanced DirectAccess Deployment](Plan-an-Advanced-DirectAccess-Deployment.md).
