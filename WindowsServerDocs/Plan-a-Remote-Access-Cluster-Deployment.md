# Plan a Remote Access Cluster Deployment
[!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_1](includes/winthreshold_server_1_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[win8_server_1](includes/win8_server_1_md.md)] combine DirectAccess and Routing and Remote Access Service \(RRAS\) VPN into a single Remote Access role. This overview provides an introduction to the planning steps required in order to deploy a cluster of [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_1](includes/winthreshold_server_2_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[win8_server_2](includes/win8_server_2_md.md)] Remote Access servers.

-   [Step 1: Plan a single server Remote Access deployment](assetId:///d85aa8a8-ef06-4021-a4ea-38de816f19cd). This step includes planning for the infrastructure required to deploy a single server. It includes planning for network and server settings, certificate requirements, DNS settings, network location server deployment, DirectAccess management servers, Active Directory settings, and [!INCLUDE[gpos](includes/gpos_md.md)] \(GPOs\).

-   [Step 2: Plan a Remote Access cluster](assetId:///8fe1f2cd-2611-4eda-a1c7-16bc02377b7e) .

-   [Step 3: Plan load balancing](assetId:///22e3a2dc-4f9c-417c-9630-c329506a3e8b).

-   Step 4: Record your planning decisions for Remote Access advanced deployment. This record can be used as a job aid for everyone involved in completing the deployment steps.

After you have completed these planning steps, see [Configure a Remote Access cluster](assetId:///dad5ada5-746a-4c29-aca9-15f20624c151). For instructions on configuring a cluster deployment as a proof of concept in a lab environment, see [Test Lab Guide: Demonstrate DirectAccess in a cluster with Windows NLB](assetId:///f3e5209b-aaa9-49a7-b523-0a130ec10a4b).
