# Remote Desktop Services - VDI or session-based deployment

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016

Deploy session hosts for a more lightweight and cost effective model when requirements for user resources are lower. Take advantage of increased application compatibility and a familiar Windows Client OS experience with a VDI deployment.
