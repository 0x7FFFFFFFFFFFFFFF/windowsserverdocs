# Add the RDSH Server, create a collection, and publish the RemoteApp programs

>Applies To: Windows Server Technical Preview

Use the following steps to deploy RemoteApp programs in your desktop hosting environment. Make sure you have reviewed and completed the prerequisites before starting.  

## Add the RD Session Host to your deployment
>[NOTE] Step 1, creating a public IP address for the RDMS virtual machine, is only necessary if it does not already have one assigned.

1. Create a public IP address for the virtual machine running Remote Desktop Management Services (RDMS). The RDMS virtual machine will typically be the virtual machine running the first instance of the RD Connection Broker role.  
    1. In the Azure portal, click **Browse > Resource groups**, click the resource group for the deployment and then click the RDMS virtual machine (for example, Contoso-Cb1).  
    2. Click **Settings > Network interfaces**, and then click the corresponding network interface.   
    3. Click **Settings > IP address**.
    4. For **Public IP address**, select **Enabled**, and then click **IP address**.   
    5. If you have an existing public IP address you want to use, select it from the list. Otherwise, click **Create new**, enter a name, and then click **OK** and then **Save**.
2. Connect to the RDMS virtual machine:   
    1.  In the Azure portal click **Browse > Resource groups** and click the resource group for the deployment.  
    2.  Select the new RDMS virtual machine (for example, Contoso-Cb1).  
    3.  Click **Connect > Open** to open the Remote Desktop client.  
    4.  In the client, click **Connect**, and then click **Use another user account**. Enter the user name and password for a domain administrator account.  
    5.  Click **Yes** when warned about the certificate.  
3.  Add the new RD Web and Gateway server to Server Manager:  
    1. Launch Server Manager, click **Manage > Add Servers**.   
    2. In the Add Servers dialog, click **Find Now**.   
    3. Select the newly created RD Session Host server (for example, Contoso-Shr1) and click **OK**.
 4. Add RDSH server to the deployment  
    1. Launch Server Manager .  
    2. Click **Remote Desktop Services > Overview > Deployment Servers > Tasks > Add RD Session Host Servers**.   
    3. Select the newly created server (for example, Contoso-Shr1), and then click **Next**.  
    4. On the Confirmation page, select **Restart remote computers as needed**, and then click **Add**.  
5.  Create a file share for the RemoteApp collection user provide disks  
    1.  Open File Explorer, click **This PC**, and open the disk that you created for file shares.  
    2.  Click **Home > New Folder**.  
    3.  Enter a name for the user disks folder, for example, **UserDisksr**.  
    4.  Right-click the new folder, and then click **Properties > Sharing > Advanced Sharing**.  
    5.  Select **Share this folder**, and then click **Permissions**.

## Create a session collection and publish RemoteApp programs  
1.  In Server Manager, click **Remote Desktop Services > Collections > Tasks > Create Session Collections**.  
2.  Enter a name for the collection, for example **ContosoApps**.  
3.  Select the new RD Session Host server you created (for example, Contoso-Shr1).  
4.  Accept the default **User Groups**.  
5.  Enter the location of the file share you created for the user profile disks for this collection (for example, **\Contoso-Cb1\UserDisksr**).   
6.  Click **Create**. When the collection is created, click **Close**.  
8.  In Server Manager, select the new collection (**ContosoApps**).
