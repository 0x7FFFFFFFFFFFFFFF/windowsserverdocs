# Remote Desktop clients

>Applies To: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server Technical Preview

You can use the Microsoft Remote Desktop Client to connect to a remote PC and your work resources from almost anywhere using just about any device. You can connect to your work PC and have access to all of your apps, files, and network resources as if you were sitting at your desk. You can leave apps open at work and then see those same apps at home - all by using the RD client.

This page lists the Remote Desktop clients available for different platforms and includes links to resources that will help you get started with using Remote Desktop on your mobile device or computer.

In addition to accessing desktops and work resources, you can also use these clients with Azure RemoteApp.

Before you start, make sure you check out the [supported configuration](remote-desktop-supported-config.md) article, which discusses the PCs that you can connect to using the Remote Desktop clients.
