# Managing Your MultiPoint Services System
MultiPoint Services enables multiple stations to be connected to one computer. A traditional station consists of a [*station hub*](Switch-Between-Modes.md) or zero client, monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Network\-connected Remote Desktop Protocol \(RDP\) clients are also supported.  
  
The following illustration shows an example layout of a MultiPoint Services system that contains four *stations*. Such a setup enables multiple users to use the computer at the same time, and to perform independent work or a group activity.

MultiPoint Services includes [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_manager](./includes/win8_server_multipoint_manager_md.md)], which helps you, as an *administrative user*, to monitor and manage your MultiPoint system, and [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_dashboard](./includes/win8_server_multipoint_dashboard_md.md)], which provides day-to-day administrative functionality. The topics included in this Help guide describe many of the tasks that you can perform in [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_manager](./includes/win8_server_multipoint_manager_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_dashboard](./includes/win8_server_multipoint_dashboard_md.md)].
