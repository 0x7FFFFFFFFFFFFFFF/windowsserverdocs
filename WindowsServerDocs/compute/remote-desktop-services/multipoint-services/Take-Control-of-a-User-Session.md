# Take Control of a User Session
As a MultiPoint Dashboard User, you can assist another user by remotely accessing his or her desktop using the Take Control feature.  
  
#### To take control of a user’s desktop  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_dashboard](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/includes/win8_server_multipoint_dashboard_md.md)], on the **Home** tab, click the thumbnail image of the desktop for the user you want to assist.  
  
2.  On the **Assist** tab, click **Take Control**. The user’s desktop opens on your desktop, and then you can navigate their desktop using your keyboard and mouse.  
  
3.  When you are finished assisting the user, in [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_dashboard](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/includes/win8_server_multipoint_dashboard_md.md)] click **Stop**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > You may need to minimize the user’s desktop to see your [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_dashboard](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/includes/win8_server_multipoint_dashboard_md.md)].
