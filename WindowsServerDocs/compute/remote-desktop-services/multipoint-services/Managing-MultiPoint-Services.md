# Managing MultiPoint Services
MultiPointâ„¢ Services allows multiple users, each with their own independent Windows experience, to simultaneously share one computer. User stations, consisting of a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, are directly connected to the host computer through USB, video cables, or the network.  
  
The information in this section describes many of the tasks that you can perform in [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_manager](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/includes/win8_server_multipoint_manager_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_dashboard](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/includes/win8_server_multipoint_dashboard_md.md)], such as how to manage MultiPoint Services stations by using [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_manager](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/includes/win8_server_multipoint_manager_md.md)], and how to use [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_dashboard](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/includes/win8_server_multipoint_dashboard_md.md)] daily.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> The information in this section is also included in the MultiPoint Services Help, which can be opened by clicking the Help icon or F1 on any [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_manager](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/includes/win8_server_multipoint_manager_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_dashboard](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/includes/win8_server_multipoint_dashboard_md.md)] screen.
