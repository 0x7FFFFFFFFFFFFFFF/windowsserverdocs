# Remap Selected MultiPoint Systems
Remapping stations in MultiPoint Dashboard allows you to associate keyboards and mice to monitors. Local user stations are suspended while a MultiPoint Services system is remapped.  
  
> [!CAUTION]  
> Remapping is commonly used for troubleshooting purposes. Station settings, such as name and auto\-logon information, are erased during the remapping process.  
  
#### To remap a MultiPoint Services system  
  
1.  In MultiPoint Services, click the **Systems** tab.  
  
2.  Click the thumbnail image of the server you want to remap, and then, on the **Hardware** tab, click **Remap Selected System**.
