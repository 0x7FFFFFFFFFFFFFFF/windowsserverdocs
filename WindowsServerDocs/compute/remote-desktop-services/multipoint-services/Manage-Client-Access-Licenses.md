# Manage Client Access Licenses
Every station that connects to a MultiPoint Services system, including the computer running MultiPoint Services that is used as a station, must have a valid per-user Remote Desktop *client access license (CAL)*.

If you are using station virtual desktops instead of physical stations, you must install a CAL for each station virtual desktop.  
  
1.  Purchase a client license for each station that is connected to your MultiPoint Services computer or server. For more information about purchasing CALs, visit the documentation for Remote Desktop licensing. <!--@Liza: add link to RDS licensing here-->

2.  From the **Start** screen, open **MultiPoint Manager**.  
  
3.  Click the **Home** tab, and then click **Add client access licenses**.  This will open the management tool for CAL licensing.
