# Manage Client Access Licenses
Every station that connects to a MultiPoint Services system, including the computer running MultiPoint Services that is used as a station, must have a valid per-user Remote Desktop *client access license \(CAL\)*. **Add Client Access Licenses** opens the RD Licensing manager, where you can manage the CALs as you need for your MultiPoint Services system.
