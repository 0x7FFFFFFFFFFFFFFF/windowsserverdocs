# Managing Client Access licenses with MultiPoint Services
To enable users to use stations in MultiPoint Services, you must obtain and install a Client Access License \(CAL\) for each station. If you are using station virtual desktops instead of physical stations, you must install a CAL for each station virtual desktop.  
  
#### To add client access licenses \(CALs\) in MultiPoint Services  
  
1.  Purchase a client license for each station that is connected to your MultiPoint Services computer or server. For more information about purchasing CALs, visit the documentation for Remote Desktop licensing. <!--@Liza: add link to RDS licensing here-->

2.  From the **Start** screen, open **MultiPoint Manager**.  
  
3.  Click the **Home** tab, and then click **Add client access licenses**.  This will open the management tool for CAL licensing.
