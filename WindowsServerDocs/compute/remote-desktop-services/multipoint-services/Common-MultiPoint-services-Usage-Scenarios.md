# Common Usage Scenarios
MultiPoint Services delivers individual user desktops with the most important elements of the Windows 10 desktop experience. It also offers a simple management tool, the MultiPoint Manager, that system administrators can use for discovery and control of multiple MultiPoint servers and clients. Additionally, MultiPoint Services includes the MultiPoint Dashboard for real-time visibility. Examples of what you can do with MultiPoint Services include the following:  
  
1.  Give each user a personal computing experience and private folders without needing a separate computer for each person.  
  
2.  Manage multiple MultiPoint systems in a computer lab, classroom, training center, or small business environment.  
  
3.  Install a program once, and access it from any station.  
  
4.  Monitor each user’s desktop activity.  
  
5.  Block screens with a customizable message to get the group’s attention.  
  
6.  Restrict the group to only accessing one or more websites.  
  
7.  Project your screen to the other screens to demonstrate a particular task.  
  
8.  Communicate privately with a standard user who is asking for help.  
  
9. Take control of a user’s session to demonstrate a task.  
  
10. Do all of the above-listed items for a user who is using a traditional PC, laptop, or any other mobile device.
