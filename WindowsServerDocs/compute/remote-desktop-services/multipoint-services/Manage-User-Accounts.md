# Manage User Accounts
This section describes the different types of user accounts, how to create user accounts, and how to manage user accounts. In a MultiPoint Services system, there are two types of user accounts, *standard user accounts* and *administrative user accounts*, as described below.  
  
> [!TIP]  
> The [User Account Considerations](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-2/User-Account-Considerations.md) topic provides guidelines that you should consider as you create and manage user accounts.
