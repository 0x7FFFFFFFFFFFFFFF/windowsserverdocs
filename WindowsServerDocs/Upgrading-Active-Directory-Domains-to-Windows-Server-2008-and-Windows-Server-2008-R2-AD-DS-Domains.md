# Upgrading Active Directory Domains to Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2 AD DS Domains
Upgrading your network operating system requires minimal network configuration and typically has a low impact on user operations. The upgrade process is straightforward, efficient, and allows your organization to take advantage of the improved security that is offered by the [!INCLUDE[firstref_longhorn](includes/firstref_longhorn_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nextref_server_7](includes/nextref_server_7_md.md)] operating systems.  
  
## About this guide  
This guide is intended for use by system administrators and system engineers. It provides detailed guidance for upgrading Windows 2000 or Windows Server 2003 Active Directory domains to Active Directory Domain Services \(AD DS\) domains that have domain controllers running [!INCLUDE[nextref_longhorn](includes/nextref_longhorn_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[nextref_server_7](includes/nextref_server_7_md.md)]. For a seamless deployment experience, use the checklists that are provided in this guide and complete the tasks in the order in which they are presented.
