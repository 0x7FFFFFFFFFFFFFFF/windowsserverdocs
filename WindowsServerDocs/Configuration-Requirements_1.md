The following components are required for configuring DirectAccess in the test lab:  
  
-   The product disc or files for [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_1](includes/winthreshold_server_1_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[winblue_server_1](includes/winblue_server_1_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[win8_server_1](includes/win8_server_1_md.md)].  
  
-   Six computers or virtual machines that meet the minimum hardware requirements for [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_2](includes/winthreshold_server_2_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[winblue_server_2](includes/winblue_server_2_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[win8_server_2](includes/win8_server_2_md.md)]; two of these computers have two network adapters installed.  
  
-   The product disc or files for [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_client_1](includes/winthreshold_client_1_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[win8_client_1](includes/win8_client_1_md.md)].
