| [Integration with Azure Site Recovery Services](azure-site-recovery-services-integration.md) | When a virtual machine that is protected fails, or the host server that the protected virtual machine runs on fails, failing-over to Azure can be done to maintain business continuity until the on premise virtual machine or host server is repaired and available.  | Azure Site Recovery Services are a service offered by Microsoft Azure enabling real-time replication of your virtual machines (VM) to a backup vault in Azure. In the event that your server, or site, is down due to a hardware or other failure, the user can fail-over to Azure where the VM image stored in your backup vault will be provisioned as a running VM in Azure. Combined with an Azure Virtual Network, in the event of a failover to Azure, client PCs that previously connected to the on-premises server will transparently connect to the server running in Azure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [Integration with Azure Virtual Network](azure-virtual-network-integration.md)               | Configure your Azure Virtual Network through a simple wizard that helps you choose the most appropriate defaults for your networked environment.                                                                                                                       | As organizations make their way to cloud computing, rarely will they move all of their resources 100% at one time, but rather take an approach where some resources are in the cloud and some are still on premises. This hybrid approach makes it easy for organizations to not only move some computing resources to the cloud, but also enables them to grow their IT infrastructure without having to acquire new hardware. When implementing this hybrid approach to computing, a seamless way for resources in both locations to communicate with one another is required. Azure Virtual Networking is an Azure service that enables organizations to create a point-to-point (P2P) or site-to-site (S2S) virtual private network that makes the resources that are running in Azure (such as virtual machines and storage) look as though they are on the local network for seamless application and resource access. |
