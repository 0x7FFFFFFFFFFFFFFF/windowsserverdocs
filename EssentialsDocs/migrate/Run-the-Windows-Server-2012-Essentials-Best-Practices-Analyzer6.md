# Run the Windows Server 2012 Essentials Best Practices Analyzer6
When you finish migrating your settings and data to [!INCLUDE[sbs_sbs8web_2](../install/includes/sbs_sbs8web_2_md.md)], you should run the [!INCLUDE[sbs_sbs8web_2](../install/includes/sbs_sbs8web_2_md.md)] Best Practices Analyzer (BPA) on the Destination Server. The BPA examines a server that is running [!INCLUDE[sbs_sbs8web_2](../install/includes/sbs_sbs8web_2_md.md)] and presents a report that describes issues and provides recommendations for resolving them. The recommendations are developed by the product support organization for [!INCLUDE[sbs_sbs8web_2](../install/includes/sbs_sbs8web_2_md.md)].  
  
### To run the [!INCLUDE[sbs_sbs8web_2](../install/includes/sbs_sbs8web_2_md.md)] BPA on the Destination Server  
  
1.  Log on to the Destination Server as an administrator, and then open the Dashboard.  
  
2.  In the Dashboard, click the **Devices** tab.  
  
3.  In the *Server***Tasks** pane, click **Best Practices Analyzer**.  
  
4.  Review each BPA message, and follow the instructions to resolve issues if necessary.
