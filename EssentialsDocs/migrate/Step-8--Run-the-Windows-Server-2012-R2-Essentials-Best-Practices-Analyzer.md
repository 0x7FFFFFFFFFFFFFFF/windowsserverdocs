# Step 8: Run the Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials Best Practices Analyzer
When you finish migrating your settings and data to [!INCLUDE[wseblue_2](../install/includes/wseblue_2_md.md)], you should run the [!INCLUDE[wseblue_2](../install/includes/wseblue_2_md.md)] Best Practices Analyzer (BPA) on the Destination Server. The BPA examines a server that is running [!INCLUDE[wseblue_2](../install/includes/wseblue_2_md.md)] and presents a report that describes issues and provides recommendations for resolving them. The recommendations are developed by the product support organization for [!INCLUDE[wseblue_2](../install/includes/wseblue_2_md.md)].  
  
### To run the [!INCLUDE[wseblue_2](../install/includes/wseblue_2_md.md)] BPA on the Destination Server  
  
1.  Log on to the Destination Server as an administrator, and then open Server Manager.  
  
2.  In Server Manager, click the **Windows Server Essentials Experience** tab.  
  
3.  In the details pane, select **Best Practices Analyzer**.  
  
4.  Click **Tasks**, and then click **Start BPA scan**.  
  
5.  Review each BPA message, and follow the instructions to resolve issues, if necessary.  
  
## Next steps  
 You have run the [!INCLUDE[wseblue_2](../install/includes/wseblue_2_md.md)] Best Practices Analyzer. Your migration to [!INCLUDE[wseblue_2](../install/includes/wseblue_2_md.md)] is now complete.  
  
 To view all the steps, see [Migrate to Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials](../migrate/Migrate-from-Previous-Versions-to-Windows-Server-2012-R2-Essentials-or-Windows-Server-Essentials-Experience.md).
