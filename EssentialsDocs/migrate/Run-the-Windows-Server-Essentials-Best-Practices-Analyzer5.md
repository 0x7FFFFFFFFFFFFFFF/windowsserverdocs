# Run the Windows Server Essentials Best Practices Analyzer5
When you finish migrating your settings and data to  Windows Server Essentials, you should run the  Windows Server Essentials Best Practices Analyzer (BPA) on the Destination Server. The BPA examines a server that is running  Windows Server Essentials and presents a report that describes issues and provides recommendations for resolving them. The recommendations are developed by the product support organization for  Windows Server Essentials.  
  
### To run the  Windows Server Essentials BPA on the Destination Server  
  
1.  Sign on to the Destination Server as an administrator, and then open the Dashboard.  
  
2.  On the Dashboard, click the **DEVICES** tab.  
  
3.  In the *Server***Tasks** pane, click **Best Practices Analyzer**.  
  
4.  Review each BPA message, and follow the instructions to resolve issues if necessary.
