# Prepare the Technician Computer
The technician computer contains the tools and documentation in the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK), and it is where you customize the image of the operating system that you intend to deploy. Complete the following to prepare the technician computer.  
  
-   Prepare a computer with the Windows 7 or Windows 8 Consumer Preview.  
  
-   Install Windows ADK on the computer running Windows 7 or [!INCLUDE[win8_client_2](../install/includes/win8_client_2_md.md)] from the [Microsoft website](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=248647).
