 Windows Server Essentials does not need to be a primary server within a Windows domain. You can add Windows Server Essentials as a member server to an existing Active Directory domain environment and take advantage of the simple data protection, secure remote access, and cloud integration features that it provides. In addition, Windows Server Essentials can be deployed in an existing Active Directory environment without having to be a domain controller. This enables you to extend storage or to use a branch office for local storage and administration.  
  
 You can add Windows Server Essentials in the following scenarios:  
  
-   Add Windows Server Essentials in a branch office location and join it to the domain controller that is located in the main office at a separate location by using the native tools. You can turn on the BranchCache features for optimum bandwidth utilization on this member server.
