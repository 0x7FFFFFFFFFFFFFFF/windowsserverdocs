# Getting Started with the Windows Server 2012 Essentials ADK
The Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK) for the [!INCLUDE[sbs_sbs8web_2](../install/includes/sbs_sbs8web_2_md.md)] server software is based on the ADK for the [!INCLUDE[win8_server_1](../install/includes/win8_server_1_md.md)] operating system, so the documentation for that ADK applies here, unless otherwise noted. The information included here is specific to partners who intend to preinstall the operating system for their customers.
