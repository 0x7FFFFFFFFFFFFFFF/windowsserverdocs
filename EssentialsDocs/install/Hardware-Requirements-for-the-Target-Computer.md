# Hardware Requirements for the Target Computer
This section provides hardware requirements for [!INCLUDE[sbs_sbs8web_2](../install/includes/sbs_sbs8web_2_md.md)].  
  
## Hardware requirements for Windows Server 2012 Essentials  
 You must install [!INCLUDE[sbs_sbs8web_2](../install/includes/sbs_sbs8web_2_md.md)] on the target computer that meets the requirements in the following table.  
  
### Table 1:  System Requirements for Windows Server 2012 Essentials  
  
|Component|Minimum|Recommended*|Maximum|  
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|  
|CPU socket|1.4 GHz (64-bit processor) or faster for single core<br /><br /> 1.3 GHz (64-bit processor) or faster for multi-core|3.1 GHz (64-bit processor) or faster multi-core|2 sockets|  
|Memory (RAM)|2 GB|16 GB|64 GB|  
|Hard disks and available storage space|160 GB hard disk with a 60 GB system partition||No limit|  
  
 *Recommended hardware requirements to support [!INCLUDE[sbs_sbs8web_2](../install/includes/sbs_sbs8web_2_md.md)] maximum user and device limits.  
  
## Additional hardware and software requirements  
 The following table lists additional hardware and software requirements.  
  
|Component|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|Network adapter|Gigabit Ethernet adapter (10/100/1000baseT PHY/MAC)|  
|Internet|Some functionality may require Internet access (fees may apply) or a Windows LiveÂ® ID Account|

|Router|A router or firewall that supports IPv4 NAT|  
|Additional requirements|DVD-ROM drive|  
  
 Actual requirements will vary based on your system configuration and the applications and features you choose to install. Processor performance depends not only on the clock frequency of the processor, but also on the number of cores and the size of the processor cache. Storage space requirements for the system partition are approximate. Additional available storage space may be required if you are installing over a network.  
  
 For more information about the hardware requirements, see the [Windows Server Catalog](http://www.windowsservercatalog.com).  
  
 All server hardware should meet the requirements established for the [!INCLUDE[win8_server_2](../install/includes/win8_server_2_md.md)] Logo Program for Systems. For more information, see [Windows Logo Program](http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/winlogo/hwrequirements.mspx).
