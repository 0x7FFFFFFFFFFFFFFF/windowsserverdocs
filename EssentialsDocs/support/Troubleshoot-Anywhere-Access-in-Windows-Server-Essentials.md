# Troubleshoot Anywhere Access in Windows Server Essentials
This topic provides general instructions for using the Repair Anywhere Access wizard in  Windows Server 2012 Essentials to troubleshoot issues preventing network users from accessing server resources. Anywhere Access functionalities – Remote Web Access, virtual private network (VPN), and DirectAccess – enable network users to access server resources from any location with an Internet connection, at any time, from any device.  
  
 The Repair Anywhere Access wizard attempts to identify and repair issues with your router, domain name, or firewall that are preventing network users from remotely accessing server resources.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  For the most current troubleshooting information from the  Windows Server 2012 Essentials community, we suggest that you visit the [Windows Server Essentials Forum](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/winserveressentials/threads). The Windows Server Essentials Forum is a great place to search for help, or to ask a question.
