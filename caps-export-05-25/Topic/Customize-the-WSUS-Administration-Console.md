# Customize the WSUS Administration Console
You can configure how information about [!INCLUDE[wsus_firstref_30SP2](../Token/wsus_firstref_30SP2_md.md)] 3.0Â SP2 is displayed in the WSUS Administration console in the following ways:  
  
-   You can display information from downstream replica servers when you view computer and update status information.  
  
-   You can display validation errors in pop\-up windows. If this option is not selected, validation errors display as Tooltips.  
  
-   You can display information in the **Computer Overview To Do** section.
