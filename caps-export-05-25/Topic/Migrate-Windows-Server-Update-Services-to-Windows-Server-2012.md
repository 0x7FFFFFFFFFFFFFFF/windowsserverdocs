# Migrate Windows Server Update Services to Windows Server 2012
This document describes the process to migrate an existing Windows Server Update Services \(WSUS\) 3.0 SP2 server role to a destination server that is running [!INCLUDE[win8_server_2](../Token/win8_server_2_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[winblue_server_2](../Token/winblue_server_2_md.md)]. This document includes instructions for moving the updates, settings, target groups, and computers to the new server. By using the tools that are described in this document, you can simplify the migration process, reduce migration time, increase the accuracy of the migration process, and help eliminate possible conflicts that might otherwise occur during the migration process.
