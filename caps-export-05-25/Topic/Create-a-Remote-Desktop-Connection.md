# Create a Remote Desktop Connection
  If Remote Desktop is enabled on a server, you can use this procedure to create a new Remote Desktop Connection to connect to the server and manage it remotely. Remote Desktop is disabled by default in Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2003 R2, and [!INCLUDE[nextref_longhorn](../Token/nextref_longhorn_md.md)] operating systems.  
  
 Membership in **Remote Desktop Users**, or equivalent, is the minimum required to complete this procedure. If the remote computer is a domain controller, you must have the **Allow Logon Locally** right applied in the Default Domain Controllers Policy. Members of **Account Operators**, **Administrators**, **Enterprise Admins**, **Domain Admins**, **Backup Operators**, **Print Operators**, and **Server Operators** have the user right to log on locally to a domain controller by default. [!INCLUDE[review_details](../Token/review_details_md.md)]  
  
### To create a new Remote Desktop Connection  
  
1.  On the **Start** menu, point to **Programs** or **All Programs**, click **Accessories**, and then click **Remote Desktop Connection**.  
  
2.  In **Computer**, type a computer name or IP address, and then click **Connect**.  
  
3.  In the **Windows Security** dialog box, type your password, and then click **OK**. If you are not logged on with an account that is a member of the Remote Desktop Users, or equivalent, click **Use another account**, and then provide credentials for the appropriate account.
