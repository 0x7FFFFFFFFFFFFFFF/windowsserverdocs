# DHCP Overview
DHCP is an Internet Engineering Task Force \(IETF\) standard designed to reduce the administration burden and complexity of configuring hosts on a TCP\/IP\-based network, such as a private intranet. Using the DHCP Server service, the process of configuring TCP\/IP on DHCP clients is automatic.
