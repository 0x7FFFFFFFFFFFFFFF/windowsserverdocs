# DNSSEC Deployment Planning
The following topics provide planning guidance. Review the information in these topics before you sign a DNS zone with DNSSEC:  
  
-   [Why DNSSEC](../Topic/Why-DNSSEC.md): Consider the reasons why you want to deploy DNSSEC. Possible reasons include protection against spoofing attacks and compliance with government corporate policies.  
  
-   [Stage a DNSSEC Deployment](../Topic/Stage-a-DNSSEC-Deployment.md): Before you fully deploy DNSSEC in a production environment, try signing a test zone.  
  
-   [DNSSEC Performance Considerations](../Topic/DNSSEC-Performance-Considerations.md): DNSSEC signing and validation requires processor resources on DNS servers. DNSSEC\-signed zones and DNS responses are also larger in size, requiring additional disk and network resources.  
  
-   [DNSSEC Requirements](../Topic/DNSSEC-Requirements.md): Before you deploy DNSSEC, verify that your DNS infrastructure meets specifications.
