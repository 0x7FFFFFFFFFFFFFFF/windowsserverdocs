# Managing the Wireless Network (IEEE 802.11) Policies
In [!INCLUDE[win8_server_1](../Token/win8_server_1_md.md)], the Wireless Network \(IEEE 802.11\) Policies extension of Group Policy contains two policy nodes. You can use the New Wireless Network Policy to configure wireless settings on computers running [!INCLUDE[win8_client_1](../Token/win8_client_1_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[firstref_client_7](../Token/firstref_client_7_md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[firstref_vista](../Token/firstref_vista_md.md)]. You can use the Wireless Network Policy to configure wireless settings on computers running Windows®°XP°with°SP2, Windows°XP°with°SP1, or Windows°Server®°2003.  
  
The following resources provide details about configuring 802.1X authenticated wireless access using the Wireless Network \(IEEE 802.11\) Policies extension of Group Policy.  
  
-   Information about the New Wireless Network Policy is provided in the topic, [Managing the New Wireless Network &#40;IEEE 802.11&#41; Policies Settings](../Topic/Managing-the-New-Wireless-Network--IEEE-802.11--Policies-Settings.md). This topic provides prescriptive guidance for configuring 802.1X authenticated wireless access based on one of the authentication methods you have selected when configuring the New Wireless Network Policy, as well as configuration details about the individual settings.  
  
    -   The Advanced tab in the New Wireless Network Policies contains many of the same settings as are found on the Advanced tab in the Wired Network \(IEEE 802.3\) Policies. The settings for both the New Wireless Network Policies and the Wired Network \(IEEE 802.3\) Policies are all documented in the topic: [Advanced Security Settings for Wired and Wireless Network Policies](../Topic/Advanced-Security-Settings-for-Wired-and-Wireless-Network-Policies.md).  
  
-   Information about the Wireless Network Policy to configure wireless settings on computers running Windows°XP is provided in the topic, [Managing the Windows XP-based Wireless Network Policies](../Topic/Managing-the-Windows-XP-based-Wireless-Network-Policies.md). This topic provides prescriptive guidance for configuring 802.1X authenticated wireless access based on one of the authentication methods you have selected when configuring the New Wireless Network Policy, as well as configuration details about the individual settings.  
  
-   Within the Wireless Network \(IEEE 802.11\) Policies there are settings to configure Extensible Authentication Protocol \(EAP\).  
  
    The EAP is an architectural framework that provides extensibility for authentication methods for commonly used protected network access technologies, such as IEEE 802.1X\-based wireless access, IEEE 802.1X\-based wired access, and Point\-to\-Point Protocol \(PPP\) connections such as Virtual Private Networking \(VPN\). EAP is not an authentication method like MS\-CHAP v2, but rather a framework on the access client and authentication server that allows networking vendors to develop and easily install new authentication methods known as EAP methods. For EAP setting details, see [Extensible Authentication Protocol &#40;EAP&#41; Settings for Network Access](../Topic/Extensible-Authentication-Protocol--EAP--Settings-for-Network-Access.md)
