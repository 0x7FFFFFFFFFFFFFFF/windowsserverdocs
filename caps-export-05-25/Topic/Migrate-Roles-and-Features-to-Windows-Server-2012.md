# Migrate Roles and Features to Windows Server 2012
Migration documentation and tools ease the process of migrating server roles, features, operating system settings, and data from an existing server that is running Windows ServerÂ 2003, [!INCLUDE[nextref_longhorn](../Token/nextref_longhorn_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[nextref_server_7](../Token/nextref_server_7_md.md)], or [!INCLUDE[win8_server_2](../Token/win8_server_2_md.md)] to a computer that is running [!INCLUDE[win8_server_2](../Token/win8_server_2_md.md)]. By using migration guides linked to on this page \(and where appropriate, [!INCLUDE[wsmt](../Token/wsmt_md.md)]\) to migrate [!INCLUDE[rrsandf_plural](../Token/rrsandf_plural_md.md)], you can simplify deployment of new servers \(including those that are running the Server Core installation option of [!INCLUDE[win8_server_2](../Token/win8_server_2_md.md)], and virtual servers\), reduce migration downtime, increase accuracy of the migration process, and help eliminate conflicts that could otherwise occur during the migration process.
