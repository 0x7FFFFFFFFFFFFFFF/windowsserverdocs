# Update the IP Address for a DNS Delegation
  If you change the IP address of a domain controller that is a Domain Name System \(DNS\) server, you must update the IP address in the delegation for the DNS server in the DNS zone for the parent domain. You can use this procedure to update the IP address of a delegation for a domain controller that is also a DNS server.  
  
 Membership in **Domain Admins**, or equivalent, is the minimum required to complete this procedure. [!INCLUDE[review_details](../Token/review_details_md.md)]  
  
### To update the IP address for a DNS delegation  
  
1.  Open the DNS snap\-in: On the **Start** menu, point to **Administrative Tools**, and then click **DNS**.
