# Planning Federation Server Proxy Placement
After you gather all the information that you will use to design your [!INCLUDE[firstref_adfs2](../Token/firstref_adfs2_md.md)] infrastructure and after you plan your [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs](../Token/adfs2_fs_md.md)] and Web server strategy, you can plan when and where to place [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs](../Token/adfs2_fs_md.md)] proxies in your new design. The information in the following topics can help you determine when and where to place a [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fsp](../Token/adfs2_fsp_md.md)] and whether to configure it for the account partner role or the resource partner role:  
  
-   [Review the Role of the Federation Server in the Account Partner](../Topic/Review-the-Role-of-the-Federation-Server-in-the-Account-Partner.md)  
  
-   [Review the Role of the Federation Server Proxy in the Resource Partner](../Topic/Review-the-Role-of-the-Federation-Server-Proxy-in-the-Resource-Partner.md)  
  
-   [When to Create a Federation Server Proxy](../Topic/When-to-Create-a-Federation-Server-Proxy.md)  
  
-   [Where to Place a Federation Server Proxy](../Topic/Where-to-Place-a-Federation-Server-Proxy.md)  
  
-   [When to Create a Federation Server Proxy Farm](../Topic/When-to-Create-a-Federation-Server-Proxy-Farm.md)  
  
-   [Certificate Requirements for Federation Server Proxies](../Topic/Certificate-Requirements-for-Federation-Server-Proxies.md)  
  
-   [Name Resolution Requirements for Federation Server Proxies](../Topic/Name-Resolution-Requirements-for-Federation-Server-Proxies.md)  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Although this information might help with your placement planning for [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs](../Token/adfs2_fs_md.md)] proxies, it does not explain how to determine the proper number of proxies and the proxy hardware requirements for each [!INCLUDE[nextref_adfs2](../Token/nextref_adfs2_md.md)] design.  
  
For examples of how you can place a [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fsp](../Token/adfs2_fsp_md.md)] in either of the two primary [!INCLUDE[nextref_adfs2](../Token/nextref_adfs2_md.md)] design scenarios, see [Mapping Your Deployment Goals to an AD FS Design](../Topic/Mapping-Your-Deployment-Goals-to-an-AD-FS-Design.md).
