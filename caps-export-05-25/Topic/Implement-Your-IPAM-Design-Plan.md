# Implement Your IPAM Design Plan
After you have decided on an IPAM design, the next step in implementing your design is to determine in what order each of the deployment tasks must be performed. This guide uses checklists to help you walk through the various server and application deployment tasks that are required to implement your design plan. As shown in the following illustration, parent and child checklists are used as necessary to represent the order in which tasks for a specific IPAM design must be performed. For IPAM, many of the tasks are similar across the three different design choices, and only differ in terms of server placement and management scope.
