# Join computers to the new Windows Server 2012 Essentials network
The next step in the migration process is to join client computers to the new [!INCLUDE[sbs_sbs8web_2](../Token/sbs_sbs8web_2_md.md)] network.  
  
### To join a computer to the [!INCLUDE[sbs_sbs8web_2](../Token/sbs_sbs8web_2_md.md)] network  
  
-   From a client computer, browse to **http:\/\/***destination\-servername***\/connect** and follow the onscreen instructions.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > The installation process is the same for domain\-joined or non\-domain\-joined client computers.
