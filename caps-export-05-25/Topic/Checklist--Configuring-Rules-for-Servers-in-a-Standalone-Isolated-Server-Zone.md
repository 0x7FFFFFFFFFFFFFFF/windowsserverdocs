# Checklist: Configuring Rules for Servers in a Standalone Isolated Server Zone
This checklist includes tasks for configuring connection security rules and IPsec settings in your GPOs for servers in a standalone isolated server zone that is not part of an isolated domain. In addition to requiring authentication and optionally encryption, servers in a server isolation zone are accessible only by users or computers that are authenticated as members of a network access group \(NAG\). The GPOs described here apply only to the isolated servers, not to the client computers that connect to them. For the GPOs for the client computers, see [Checklist: Creating Rules for Clients of a Standalone Isolated Server Zone](../Topic/Checklist--Creating-Rules-for-Clients-of-a-Standalone-Isolated-Server-Zone.md).  
  
The GPOs for isolated servers are similar to those for an isolated domain. This checklist refers you to those procedures for the creation of some of the rules. The other procedures in this checklist are for creating the restrictions that allow only members of the server access group to connect to the server.  
  
## <a name="bkmk_section1"></a>![](../Image/2b05dce3-938f-4168-9b8f-1f4398cbdb9b.gif)**Checklist: Configuring rules for isolated servers running Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2**  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> The GPOs for computers running [!INCLUDE[win8_client_2](../Token/win8_client_2_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[nextref_client_7](../Token/nextref_client_7_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[nextref_vista](../Token/nextref_vista_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[win8_server_2](../Token/win8_server_2_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[nextref_longhorn](../Token/nextref_longhorn_md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[nextref_server_7](../Token/nextref_server_7_md.md)] are usually similar. If this is true for your design, create one GPO, configure it by using the tasks in this checklist, and then create a copy of the GPO for the other operating system. For example, create and configure the GPO for [!INCLUDE[win8_client_2](../Token/win8_client_2_md.md)], make a copy of it for [!INCLUDE[win8_server_2](../Token/win8_server_2_md.md)], and then follow the steps in this checklist to make the few required changes to the copy.  
  
||Task|Reference|  
|-|--------|-------------|  
|![](../Image/WFAS_icon_checkbox.gif)|Create a GPO for the computers that need to have access restricted to the same set of client computers. If there are multiple servers running different versions of the Windows operating system, start by creating the GPO for one version of Windows. After you have finished the tasks in this checklist and configured the GPO for that version of Windows, you can create a copy of it.|![](../Image/bc6cea1a-1c6c-4124-8c8f-1df5adfe8c88.gif)[Checklist: Creating Group Policy Objects](../Topic/Checklist--Creating-Group-Policy-Objects.md)<br /><br />![](../Image/bc6cea1a-1c6c-4124-8c8f-1df5adfe8c88.gif)[Copy a GPO to Create a New GPO](../Topic/Copy-a-GPO-to-Create-a-New-GPO.md)|

|![](../Image/WFAS_icon_checkbox.gif)|Configure the authentication methods to be used. This procedure sets the default settings for the computer. If you want to set authentication on a per\-rule basis, this procedure is optional.|![](../Image/15dd35b6-6cc6-421f-93f8-7109920e7144.gif)[Configure Authentication Methods on Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2](../Topic/Configure-Authentication-Methods-on-Windows-8,-Windows-7,-Windows-Vista,-Windows-Server-2012,-Windows-Server-2008,-and-Windows-Server-2008-R2.md)|  
|![](../Image/WFAS_icon_checkbox.gif)|Create a rule that requests authentication for all inbound network traffic. **Important:** Just as in an isolated domain, do not set the rules to require authentication until your testing is complete. That way, if the rules do not work as expected, communications are not affected by a failure to authenticate.|![](../Image/15dd35b6-6cc6-421f-93f8-7109920e7144.gif)[Create an Authentication Request Rule on Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2](../Topic/Create-an-Authentication-Request-Rule-on-Windows-8,-Windows-7,-Windows-Vista,-Windows-Server-2012,-Windows-Server-2008,-and-Windows-Server-2008-R2.md)|  
|![](../Image/WFAS_icon_checkbox.gif)|If your design requires encryption in addition to authentication for access to the isolated servers, then modify the rule to require it.|![](../Image/15dd35b6-6cc6-421f-93f8-7109920e7144.gif)[Configure the Rules to Require Encryption on Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2](../Topic/Configure-the-Rules-to-Require-Encryption-on-Windows-8,-Windows-7,-Windows-Vista,-Windows-Server-2012,-Windows-Server-2008,-and-Windows-Server-2008-R2.md)|  
|![](../Image/WFAS_icon_checkbox.gif)|Create the NAG to contain the computer or user accounts that are allowed to access the isolated servers. If you have multiple groups of isolated servers that are accessed by different client computers, then create a NAG for each set of servers.|![](../Image/15dd35b6-6cc6-421f-93f8-7109920e7144.gif)[Create a Group Account in Active Directory](../Topic/Create-a-Group-Account-in-Active-Directory.md)|  
|![](../Image/WFAS_icon_checkbox.gif)|Create a firewall rule that allows inbound network traffic only if it is authenticated from a user or computer that is a member of the zone’s NAG.|![](../Image/15dd35b6-6cc6-421f-93f8-7109920e7144.gif)[Restrict Server Access to Members of a Group Only](../Topic/Restrict-Server-Access-to-Members-of-a-Group-Only.md)|  
|![](../Image/WFAS_icon_checkbox.gif)|Link the GPO to the domain level of the Active Directory organizational unit hierarchy.|![](../Image/15dd35b6-6cc6-421f-93f8-7109920e7144.gif)[Link the GPO to the Domain](../Topic/Link-the-GPO-to-the-Domain.md)|  
|![](../Image/WFAS_icon_checkbox.gif)|Add your test server to the membership group for the isolated server zone. Be sure to add at least one for each operating system supported by a different GPO in the group.|![](../Image/15dd35b6-6cc6-421f-93f8-7109920e7144.gif)[Add Test Computers to the Membership Group for a Zone](../Topic/Add-Test-Computers-to-the-Membership-Group-for-a-Zone.md)|  
  
Do not change the rules for any of your zones to require authentication until all zones have been set up and thoroughly tested.
