# End a User Session
You should end a user’s session when you have to log the user off from the MultiPoint Services system to return the desktop to its default settings. The user receives a warning that the connection is about to end. You should end a user’s connection when you want to:  
  
-   Restart the MultiPoint Services system computer  
  
-   Shut down the MultiPoint Services system computer  
  
-   Switch modes  
  
-   Log off a user who forgot to log off  
  
#### To end user sessions  
  
1.  Open [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_manager](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_manager_md.md)] in station mode, and then click the **Stations** tab.  
  
2.  Do one of the following:  
  
    -   To end a single user session, in the **User** column, select the session you want to end, and then, under **Tasks**, click **Log off**.  
  
    -   To end all user sessions, under **Stations Tasks**, click **Log off all stations**.
