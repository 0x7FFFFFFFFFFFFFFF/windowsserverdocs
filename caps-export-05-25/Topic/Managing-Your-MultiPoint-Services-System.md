# Managing Your MultiPoint Services System
MultiPoint Services enables multiple stations to be connected to one computer. Multiple users can then share one computer at the same time. Each station consists of a *station hub* or zero client, monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Network\-connected Remote Desktop Protocol \(RDP\) clients are also supported.  
  
The following illustration shows an example layout of a MultiPoint Services system that contains four *stations*. Such a setup enables multiple users to use the computer at the same time, and to perform independent work or a group activity.

MultiPoint Services includes [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_manager](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_manager_md.md)], which helps you, as an *administrative user*, to monitor and manage your MultiPoint Services system, and [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_dashboard](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_dashboard_md.md)], which provides day-to-day administrative functionality. The topics included in this Help guide describe many of the tasks that you can perform in [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_manager](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_manager_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_dashboard](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_dashboard_md.md)].
