# Network Discovery and Topology Terminology
This topic provides terminology that is used in Network Discovery and Topology documentation.  
  
Following are definitions for some of the terminology used in Network Discovery topics.  
  
**Network Topology**. The shape and overall structure of a network, including network devices, their interfaces, and the interconnections between them  
  
**Actual topology**. The network design as you expect it to appear, and as it actually is, based on your knowledge of all network devices, their interfaces, and interconnections between devices, on your network. Also referred to as the expected topology.  
  
**Network Discovery**. A feature of Network Controller that searches for and identifies devices and wiring connectivity patterns on your network.  
  
**Discovered topology**. The results of a discovery operation that you perform with Network Controller.  
  
**Topology node**. A physical device on the network, such as a network switch or computer.  
  
**Termination point**. An interface on a topology node. For example, an Ethernet port on a switch or a physical interface on a network adapter installed in a computer.  
  
**Topology link**. A physical wired connection between two termination points. These termination points can be on the same device or on different devices.  
  
For more information about discovered topology, see [Network Elements Discovered by Network Controller](../Topic/Network-Elements-Discovered-by-Network-Controller.md).
