When you deploy IPAM in [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_1](../Token/winthreshold_server_1_md.md)], you can use IPAM to manage DNS zones.  
  
In the IPAM console, you can view DNS resource records for a specific DNS zone, and filter the records based on type, IP address, resource record data, and other filtering options. In addition, you can edit DNS resource records for specific zones
