# Configure Automatic Updates using Group Policy
In an Active Directory environment, you can use Group Policy or Registry Editor to configure Automatic Updates. This topic describes how to configure Automatic Updates by using Group Policy.  
  
Administrator\-defined configuration options always take precedence over user\-defined options.

-   [How to use the WSUS Administrative Template](../Topic/Configure-Automatic-Updates-using-Group-Policy.md#admtemp)  
  
-   [WSUS settings for Automatic Updates](../Topic/Configure-Automatic-Updates-using-Group-Policy.md#settings)  
  
## <a name="admtemp"></a>How to use the WSUS Administrative Template  
This topic assumes that you already use and are familiar with Group Policy. For more information about the Group Policy Management Console \(GPMC\), see [Group Policy Management Console &#91;New&#93;](assetId:///187307c1-94b3-422b-bb7e-e14a8aa03bd3).  
  
Group Policy options for WSUS are set in the WSUS Administrative Template, **wuau.adm**. Depending on the operating system version that you are running, the latest WSUS Administrative Template might already be loaded in the GPMC. The WSUS Administrative Template in GPMC stores most WSUS Group Policy settings in the **Computer Configuration\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\Windows Update\\** node. A few WSUS Group Policy settings are stored in the **User Configuration\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\Windows Update\\** node.  
  
To manually load the WSUS Administrative Template into GPMC, follow the instructions in [Add or Remove Classic Administrative Templates &#91;Preliminary&#93;](assetId:///0578e2f9-b075-420e-b2b3-74a0a58e453d). By default, administrative template files are stored in the **\\Program Files\\Update Services\\adm\\***language* folder, where *language* is the language that you want to use in the GPMC. For example, the **\\fra** folder contains the French version of **wuau.adm**, and the **\\enu** folder contains the American English version of **wuau.adm**.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> It is important to mention that once you deploy your domain group policy that includes automatic update settings; this will override the same settings if they were specified in the local policy. Such behavior can lead to issues like the one mentioned in the article [Clients Unable to Receive Updates with Error 8024402C](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/clients-unable-to-receive-updates-with-error-8024402c.aspx).  
  
For additional information about Administrative Templates, see [Classic Administrative Templates &#91;Preliminary&#93;](assetId:///2a8775cd-0301-4b10-a87a-8166b00cd5e0) and [Administrative Template Policy settings &#91;Preliminary&#93;](assetId:///c958e713-5466-420c-9498-e7d55def0480).  
  
## <a name="settings"></a>WSUS settings for Automatic Updates  
When the WSUS administrative template is loaded in GPMC, you can view and modify the WSUS client\-side settings that configure Automatic Updates. For additional configuration guidance for Automatic Updates, see [Review Automatic Updates settings and expected client behavior](assetId:///f4aff13a-07f0-4939-881f-95191a025fcc).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> After you set up a client computer to use WSUS, it can take up to 90 minutes before that computer displays in the WSUS Administration Console. This is because, by default, Group Policy updates every 90 minutes, with a random offset of 0–30 minutes. You can use the **gpupdate \/force** command on the client computer to force an immediate refresh of Group Policy. For more information, see [Refresh Group Policy &#91;Preliminary2&#93;](assetId:///adb36c3b-445d-46e3-a040-41fb8b475dbe) in the Network Policy Server Deployment Guide.  
  
The following table summarizes the WSUS settings that you can configure by using Group Policy. All settings reside in the **Computer Configuration** section of GPMC, unless otherwise noted. Be aware that additional Group Policy settings might be available for WSUS, because the exact set of available Group Policy settings depends on the version of the Windows operating system that is running. The GPMC user interface supplies additional information about these settings.
