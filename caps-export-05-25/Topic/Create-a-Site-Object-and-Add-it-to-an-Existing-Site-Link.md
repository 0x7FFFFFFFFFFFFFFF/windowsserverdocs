# Create a Site Object and Add it to an Existing Site Link
  To create a new site in your forest, you must create a site object in Active Directory Domain Services \(AD DS\) and then add the site object to a site link. You can use this procedure to create a site object and add it to an existing site link.  
  
 Membership in the **Enterprise Admins** group in the forest or the **Domain Admins** group in the forest root domain, or equivalent, is the minimum required to complete this procedure. [!INCLUDE[review_details](../Token/review_details_md.md)]
