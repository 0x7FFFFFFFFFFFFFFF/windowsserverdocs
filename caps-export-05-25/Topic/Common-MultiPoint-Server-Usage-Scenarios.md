# Common MultiPoint Server Usage Scenarios
[!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_3](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_3_md.md)] delivers individual user desktops with the most important elements of the Windows 8 desktop experience. It also offers a simple [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_manager](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_manager_md.md)] user interface that system administrators can use for discovery and control of multiple MultiPoint servers and clients. Additionally, [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_3](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_3_md.md)] includes the [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_dashboard](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_dashboard_md.md)] for real\-time visibility. Examples of what you can do with [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_3](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_3_md.md)] include the following:  
  
1.  Give each user a personal computing experience and private folders without needing a separate computer for each person.  
  
2.  Manage multiple MultiPoint servers in a computer lab, classroom, training center, or small business environment.  
  
3.  Install a program once, and then access it from any station.  
  
4.  Monitor thumbnail views of each standard user’s desktop activity.  
  
5.  Block screens with a customizable message to get the group’s attention.  
  
6.  Restrict the group to only accessing one or more websites.  
  
7.  Project your screen to the other screens to demonstrate a particular task.  
  
8.  Communicate privately with a standard user who is asking for help.  
  
9. Take control of a standard user’s keyboard and mouse to demonstrate a task.  
  
10. Do all of the above\-listed items for a user who is using a traditional PC, laptop, or tablet device.
