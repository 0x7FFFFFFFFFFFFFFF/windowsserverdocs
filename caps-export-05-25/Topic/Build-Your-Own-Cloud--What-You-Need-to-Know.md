# Build Your Own Cloud: What You Need to Know
You can build your own cloud infrastructure using Microsoft products and technologies such as [!INCLUDE[winblue_server_1](../Token/winblue_server_1_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vmmblue_1](../Token/vmmblue_1_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[katal_1](../Token/katal_1_md.md)], and SQL Server. Whether you are a service provider offering cloud services to tenants, an enterprise building a private cloud for departments, or an enterprise interested in combining a private\/public cloud capabilities in a hybrid cloud; Microsoft has a solution.  
  
But before you begin planning and building your own cloud, you’ll need to learn about the Microsoft products and technologies used to build the infrastructure. This topic guides you through useful topics and articles that help you learn what you need to know.  
  
> [!TIP]  
> If you prefer to not build your own cloud, but instead want a fully pre\-configured cloud solution, you can purchase the Microsoft Cloud Platform System \(CPS\). For more information, see [Cloud Platform System](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/products/cloud-platform-system/).  
  
## The basics – 100 level  
To build your network infrastructure, you need to understand [!INCLUDE[vmmblue_2](../Token/vmmblue_2_md.md)] \(VMM\) networking concepts. VMM is used to build your cloud networking infrastructure. The following topic explains VMM networking objects:  
  
-   [Virtual Machine Manager Network Object Fundamentals](../Topic/Virtual-Machine-Manager-Network-Object-Fundamentals.md)  
  
## Intermediate – 200 level  
Learn more about VMM networking:  
  
-   [Configuring Networking in VMM](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg610596.aspx)  
  
Set up a test lab environment to see a working example of VMM network objects, tenant network isolation using Hyper\-V Networking Virtualization \(HNV\), and gateways \(not highly available\):
