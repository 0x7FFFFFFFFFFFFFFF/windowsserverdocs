# DNS Overview
The Doman Name System \(DNS\) is a system that is used in TCP\/IP networks for naming computers and network services. DNS can translate computer names and services name to other information, such as an IP address, that computers and applications need to function on a network.  
  
For more information, see [Domain Name System \(DNS\) Overview](../Topic/Domain-Name-System--DNS--Overview.md).
