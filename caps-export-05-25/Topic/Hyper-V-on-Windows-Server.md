# Hyper-V on Windows Server
The Hyper\-V role enables you to create and manage a virtualized computing environment by using virtualization technology. Installing the Hyper\-V role installs the required components and optionally installs management tools. The required components include Windows hypervisor, Hyper\-V Virtual Machine Management Service, the virtualization WMI provider, and other virtualization components such as the virtual machine bus \(VMbus\), virtualization service provider \(VSP\) and virtual infrastructure driver \(VID\).  
  
The Hyper\-V technology virtualizes hardware to provide an environment in which you can run multiple operating systems at the same time on one physical computer. Hyper\-V enables you to create and manage virtual machines and their resources. Each virtual machine is an isolated, virtualized computer system that can run its own operating system. The operating system that runs within a virtual machine is called a *guest operating system*.
