# Remote Desktop Services: Verify the Migration
Verifying the destination server configuration is best done by running a pilot program. Use an Administrator account and an account for a valid user.  
  
## Run a pilot program  
We recommend that you create a pilot program in the production environment to ensure that the migration of all role services was successful. Run the program on the servers before you put the migrated role services into production to verify that your deployment works as you expect. Depending on the role service that you migrated, you should limit connections at first, and slowly increase the number of users or connections.
