# Server Manager Help
[!INCLUDE[sm](../Token/sm_md.md)] is a management console that was first available in [!INCLUDE[firstref_longhorn](../Token/firstref_longhorn_md.md)]. In [!INCLUDE[win8_server_1](../Token/win8_server_1_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[winblue_server_1](../Token/winblue_server_1_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[sm](../Token/sm_md.md)] helps IT professionals provision and manage multiple local and remote Windows\-based servers from their desktops, without requiring physical access to servers or the need to enable Remote Desktop protocol \(RDP\) connections to each server.  
  
[!INCLUDE[sm](../Token/sm_md.md)] is recommended for managing remote servers in a midsized organization. You can use [!INCLUDE[sm](../Token/sm_md.md)] to manage larger numbers of servers, but we recommend that you monitor and limit the number of events that are collected and displayed in the **Events** tile on the **All Servers** page. Tens\-of\-thousands of event log entries can result in delayed responses from [!INCLUDE[sm](../Token/sm_md.md)]. If you need to manage an enterprise\-level number of servers in your organization, we recommend evaluating products in the Microsoft System Center suite. For more information, see [Microsoft System CenterÂ 2012](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=239437).
