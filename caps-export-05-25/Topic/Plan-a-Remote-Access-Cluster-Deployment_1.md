# Plan a Remote Access Cluster Deployment_1
[!INCLUDE[win8_server_1](../Token/win8_server_1_md.md)] combines DirectAccess and Routing and Remote Access Service \(RRAS\) VPN into a single Remote Access role. This overview provides an introduction to the planning steps required in order to deploy a cluster of [!INCLUDE[win8_server_2](../Token/win8_server_2_md.md)] Remote Access servers.  
  
-   [Step 1: Plan an Advanced Single Server Deployment](../Topic/Step-1--Plan-an-Advanced-Single-Server-Deployment.md). This step includes planning for the infrastructure required to deploy a single server. It includes planning for network and server settings, certificate requirements, DNS settings, network location server deployment, DirectAccess management servers, Active Directory settings, and [!INCLUDE[gpos](../Token/gpos_md.md)] \(GPOs\).  
  
-   [Step 2: Plan Cluster Servers_1](../Topic/Step-2--Plan-Cluster-Servers_1.md) .  
  
-   [Step 3: Plan a Load-Balanced Cluster Deployment](../Topic/Step-3--Plan-a-Load-Balanced-Cluster-Deployment.md).  
  
-   Step 4: Record your planning decisions for Remote Access advanced deployment. This record can be used as a job aid for everyone involved in completing the deployment steps.  
  
After you have completed these planning steps, see [Configure a Remote Access Cluster_1](../Topic/Configure-a-Remote-Access-Cluster_1.md). For instructions on configuring a cluster deployment as a proof of concept in a lab environment, see [Test Lab Guide: Demonstrate DirectAccess in a Cluster with Windows NLB](../Topic/Test-Lab-Guide--Demonstrate-DirectAccess-in-a-Cluster-with-Windows-NLB.md).
