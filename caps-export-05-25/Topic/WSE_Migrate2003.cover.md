### Abstract  
This guide explains how to install [!INCLUDE[sbs_sbs8_2](../Token/sbs_sbs8_2_md.md)] in migration mode on a new server, and then migrate the settings and data from the old server that is running Windows Small Business Server 2003 to the new server that is running [!INCLUDE[sbs_sbs8_2](../Token/sbs_sbs8_2_md.md)]. This guide also helps you demote and remove your old server from the network after you finish the migration process.
