# Microsoft Remote Desktop Clients
You can use the Microsoft Remote Desktop Client to connect to a remote PC and your work resources from almost anywhere using just about any device. You can connect to your work PC and have access to all of your apps, files, and network resources as if you were sitting at your desk. You can leave apps open at work and then see those same apps at home \- all by using the RD client.  
  
This page lists the Remote Desktop clients available for different platforms and includes links to resources that will help you get started with using Remote Desktop on your mobile device or computer.  
  
In addition to accessing desktops and work resources, you can also use these clients with [Azure RemoteApp](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/remoteapp/).
