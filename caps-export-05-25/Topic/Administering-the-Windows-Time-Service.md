# Administering the Windows Time Service
  Time synchronization is critical for the proper operation of many Windows services and line\-of\-business applications. The Windows Time service \(W32time\) uses the Network Time Protocol \(NTP\) to synchronize computer clocks on the network so that an accurate clock value, or time stamp, can be assigned to network validation requests and resource access requests.  
  
 This guide provides information about administering the Windows Time service in [!INCLUDE[nextref_longhorn](../Token/nextref_longhorn_md.md)].
