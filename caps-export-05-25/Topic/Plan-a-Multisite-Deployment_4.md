# Plan a Multisite Deployment_4
[!INCLUDE[win8_server_1](../Token/win8_server_1_md.md)] combines DirectAccess and Routing and Remote Access Service \(RRAS\) VPN into a single Remote Access role. This overview provides an introduction to the planning steps required in order to deploy [!INCLUDE[win8_server_1](../Token/win8_server_1_md.md)] Remote Access in a multisite configuration.  
  
1.  [Step 1: Plan an Advanced Single Server Deployment](../Topic/Step-1--Plan-an-Advanced-Single-Server-Deployment.md)—This step includes planning for the infrastructure required to deploy a single server. It includes planning for network and server settings, certificate requirements, DNS settings, network location server deployment, DirectAccess management servers, Active Directory settings, and Group Policy objects \(GPOs\).  
  
2.  [Step 2: Plan the Multisite Infrastructure_1](../Topic/Step-2--Plan-the-Multisite-Infrastructure_1.md)—This step includes Active Directory and GPO planning, and DNS configuration.  
  
3.  [Step 3: Plan the Multisite Deployment_1](../Topic/Step-3--Plan-the-Multisite-Deployment_1.md)—This step includes planning certificate settings, network location server configuration, client entry point settings, IPv6 prefix settings, and optionally global load balancing settings.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Record your planning decisions for Remote Access advanced deployment. This record can be used as a job aid for everyone involved in completing the deployment steps.  
  
After you have completed these planning steps, see [Configure a Multisite Deployment](../Topic/Configure-a-Multisite-Deployment.md). For instructions on configuring a multisite deployment as a proof of concept in a lab environment, see [Test Lab Guide: Demonstrate a DirectAccess Multisite Deployment](../Topic/Test-Lab-Guide--Demonstrate-a-DirectAccess-Multisite-Deployment.md).
