# Group Policy Management Console
  
## Install Group Policy Management Console \(GPMC\)  
Group Policy Management Console \(GPMC\) is a comprehensive administrative tool for Group Policy management.

You can install GPMC through Server Manager on the server as follows.  
  
1.  [!INCLUDE[winblue_start](../Token/winblue_start_md.md)] Server Manager. Click **Server Manager**.  
  
2.  In the main pane in **Server Manager**, click **Add roles and features**.  
  
3.  Follow the **Add Roles and Features Wizard** until you get to the **Features** menu.  
  
4.  Select **Group Policy Management** from the list of available features. Click **Install** and follow the steps in the wizard.  
  
## Open GPMC  
To start GPMC, do the following:  
  
[!INCLUDE[winblue_start](../Token/winblue_start_md.md)]**gpmc.msc**, and then click **OK** or press **ENTER**.
