# Checklist: Implementing a Certificate-based Isolation Policy Design
This parent checklist includes cross\-reference links to important concepts about using certificates as an authentication option in either a domain isolation or server isolation design.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Complete the tasks in this checklist in order. When a reference link takes you to a procedure, return to this topic after you complete the steps in that procedure so that you can proceed with the remaining tasks in this checklist  
>   
> The procedures in this section use the Group Policy MMC snap\-in interfaces to configure the GPOs, but you can also use Windows PowerShell. For more information, see [Windows Firewall with Advanced Security Administration with Windows PowerShell](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh831755.aspx) at http:\/\/technet.microsoft.com\/library\/hh831755.aspx.
