# Additional Resources for Windows Server Update Services 3.0 SP2
For additional information about installing, configuring, and using Windows Server Update Services \(WSUS\), see the following resources:  
  
-   [Windows Server Update Services home page](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=148066) on the Windows Server TechCenter.  
  
-   [WSUS Forum](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=209202) on the Windows Server TechCenter.   
    Microsoft forums are great places to exchange ideas with other users and to discuss common issues. You can read and write messages by using a Network News Transfer Protocol \(NNTP\)\-based newsreader such as Microsoft Outlook Express. You can also use the web\-based newsreader that is provided by Microsoft to access all of the newsgroups.  
  
-   [Install the WSUS 3.0 SP2 Administration Console](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=209206).  
  
-   For information about automating tasks or customizing WSUS, see the following software development kits \(SDKs\). Both SDKs contain information about the application programming interface \(API\) in addition to sample scripts and ready\-to\-use tools for your WSUS deployment and implementation.  
  
    -   [Microsoft Windows Server Update Services Software Development Kit](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=43099)  
  
    -   [Windows Update Agent Software Development Kit](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=43101)  
  
        > [!NOTE]  
        > Windows Update Agent is the service for Automatic Updates.
