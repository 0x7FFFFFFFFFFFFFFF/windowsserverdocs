# Install and Configure Advanced DirectAccess_1
This overview lists the configuration steps that are required to deploy a single DirectAccess server running [!INCLUDE[winblue_server_2](../Token/winblue_server_2_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[win8_server_2](../Token/win8_server_2_md.md)] with IPv4 and IPv6.

    In this phase, you configure network and server settings, certificate requirements, Domain Name System \(DNS\) settings, the network location server deployment, DirectAccess management servers, Active Directory settings, and Group Policy Objects \(GPOs\).  
  
-   [Step 2: Configure the DirectAccess Server_4](../Topic/Step-2--Configure-the-DirectAccess-Server_4.md).  
  
    In this phase, you configure the DirectAccess client computers, server settings, infrastructure servers, and application servers.  
  
-   [Step 3: Verify the Deployment_3](../Topic/Step-3--Verify-the-Deployment_3.md).  
  
    This step describes steps for verifying the deployment.  
  
Before you start your deployment, verify the planning steps that are described in [Plan an Advanced DirectAccess Deployment_1](../Topic/Plan-an-Advanced-DirectAccess-Deployment_1.md).
