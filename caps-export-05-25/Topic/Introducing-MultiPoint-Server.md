# Introducing MultiPoint Server
Welcome to the Windows® MultiPoint™ Server 2012 Planning Guide. [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_3](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_3_md.md)] enables multiple stations to be connected to one computer. Multiple users can then share the computer at the same time. There are several ways that stations can connect to the computer running [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_3](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_3_md.md)]:  
  
-   Directly to video ports on the computer  
  
-   Through specialized USB zero clients \(also referred to as multifunction USB hubs\), as well as through similar USB\-over\-Ethernet devices.  
  
-   Over the local area network \(LAN\)  
  
Each of these methods is described in more detail in [MultiPoint Server Stations](../Topic/MultiPoint-Server-Stations.md) later in this document.  
  
This document addresses the following factors to consider when you are planning to deploy [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_3](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_3_md.md)]:  
  
-   What type of desktops to use with your [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_3](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_3_md.md)] system: Will you need sessions, virtual machines, or Windows PCs?  
  
-   [Selecting Hardware for Your MultiPoint Server System](../Topic/Selecting-Hardware-for-Your-MultiPoint-Server-System.md): What hardware decisions should you make?  
  
-   [Hardware Requirements and Performance Recommendations](../Topic/Hardware-Requirements-and-Performance-Recommendations.md): What hardware is required to install the [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_3](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_3_md.md)] operating system?  
  
-   [MultiPoint Server Site Planning](../Topic/MultiPoint-Server-Site-Planning.md): Where will the computers that are running [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_3](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_3_md.md)] and their stations be located, and how will they be configured?  
  
-   [Network Considerations and User Accounts](../Topic/Network-Considerations-and-User-Accounts.md): The networking environment into which the [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_3](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_3_md.md)] system is deployed can affect how user accounts are managed. What is your networking environment? How will user accounts be managed?  
  
-   [Storing Files with MultiPoint Server](../Topic/Storing-Files-with-MultiPoint-Server.md): Where will user files be stored, and how will they be accessed?  
  
-   [Predeployment Checklist](../Topic/Predeployment-Checklist.md)
