# DHCP Console Icons Reference
DHCP provides context\-specific icons to dynamically represent the state of console objects. Objects include the DHCP servers, clients, scopes, and option types that are used and managed in the console.  
  
## DHCP console icons  
This topic displays new DHCP console icons that were added for [!INCLUDE[win8_server_1](../Token/win8_server_1_md.md)]. No new DHCP console icons were added for [!INCLUDE[winblue_server_2](../Token/winblue_server_2_md.md)]. To review console icons for [!INCLUDE[firstref_server_7](../Token/firstref_server_7_md.md)] and earlier operating systems, see the following icon references:
