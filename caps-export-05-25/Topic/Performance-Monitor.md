# Performance Monitor
Windows Performance Monitor is a Microsoft Management Console \(MMC\) snap\-in that provides tools for analyzing system performance. From a single console, you can monitor application and hardware performance in real time, customize the data you want to collect in logs, define thresholds for alerts and automatic actions, generate reports, and view past performance data in a variety of ways.  
  
Windows Performance Monitor performs data collection and logging using Data Collector Sets, which can contain performance counters, event trace data, and system configuration information \(registry keys\).  
  
For more information, see [Windows Performance Monitor](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc749249.aspx).
