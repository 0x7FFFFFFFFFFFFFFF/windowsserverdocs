# Telemetry Overview
You can help Microsoft improve the quality, reliability, and performance of its operating systems by participating in the Microsoft Customer Experience Improvement Program \(CEIP\) and Windows Error Reporting \(WER\). If you accept, Microsoft Corporation collects statistical information about your system configuration, the performance of some features of Windows, and certain types of events. Windows periodically uploads a small file to Microsoft that contains a summary of the information collected.
