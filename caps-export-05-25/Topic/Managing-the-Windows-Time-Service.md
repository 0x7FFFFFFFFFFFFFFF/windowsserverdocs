# Managing the Windows Time Service
  You initially configure the Windows Time service \(W32time\) when you deploy your forest root domain in Active Directory Domain Services \(ADÂ DS\). Thereafter, the Windows Time service requires little day\-to\-day management. After you make changes on your network, however, including adding certain client computers, moving the primary domain controller \(PDC\) emulator operations master role, or simply changing the time source for your network, you might need to perform certain tasks. This section includes the following tasks for managing the Windows Time service:  
  
-   [Configuring a Time Source for the Forest](../Topic/Configuring-a-Time-Source-for-the-Forest.md)  
  
-   [Configuring Windows-Based Clients to Synchronize Time](../Topic/Configuring-Windows-Based-Clients-to-Synchronize-Time.md)  
  
-   [Restoring the Windows Time Service to Default Settings](../Topic/Restoring-the-Windows-Time-Service-to-Default-Settings.md)
