# Deploying a Windows Server 2008 Forest Root Domain
Deploying your forest root domain is the first step in deploying Active Directory Domain Services \(AD DS\) in your organization. The forest root domain provides the foundation for your AD DS forest infrastructure. During the forest root domain deployment, you begin to implement the AD DS design that your design team has provided, including the Domain Name System \(DNS\) infrastructure that AD DS requires. The forest owner is responsible for deploying the forest root domain. After the forest root domain deployment is complete, deploy the remainder of your AD DS forest as specified by your Active Directory design.  
  
## About this guide  
This guide is intended for use by system administrators and system engineers. It provides detailed guidance for deploying an AD DS forest root domain. For a seamless deployment experience, use the checklists that are provided in this guide and complete the tasks in them in the order in which they are presented.
