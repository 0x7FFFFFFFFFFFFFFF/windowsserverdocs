# Software-Defined Storage Deployment Guide
This topic discusses how to deploy a Scale\-Out File Server cluster that uses Storage Spaces and easily managed Server Message Block \(SMB\) file shares to create a software\-defined storage solution for virtualized workloads. You can also use this topic to deploy other workloads such as Virtual Desktop Infrastructure \(VDI\), and SQL Server.  
  
If you want an overview of Storage Spaces, see Storage Spaces Overview.  
  
> [!TIP]  
> You can also use these topics to set up a Scale\-Out File Server with SAN\-based storage as well \- just skip the Storage Spaces\-specific steps and refer to your SAN documentation for help creating LUNs and performing other storage configuration tasks.
