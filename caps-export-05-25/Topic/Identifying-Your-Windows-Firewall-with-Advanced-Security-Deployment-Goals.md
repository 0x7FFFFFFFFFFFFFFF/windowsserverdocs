# Identifying Your Windows Firewall with Advanced Security Deployment Goals
Correctly identifying your [!INCLUDE[wfas](../Token/wfas_md.md)] deployment goals is essential for the success of your [!INCLUDE[wfas](../Token/wfas_md.md)] design project. Form a project team that can clearly articulate deployment issues in a vision statement. When you write your vision statement, identify, clarify, and refine your deployment goals. Prioritize and, if possible, combine your deployment goals so that you can design and deploy [!INCLUDE[wfas](../Token/wfas_md.md)] by using an iterative approach. You can take advantage of the predefined [!INCLUDE[wfas](../Token/wfas_md.md)] deployment goals presented in this guide that are relevant to your scenarios.  
  
The following table lists the three main tasks for articulating, refining, and subsequently documenting your [!INCLUDE[wfas](../Token/wfas_md.md)] deployment goals.  
  
|Deployment goal tasks|Reference links|  
|-------------------------|-------------------|
