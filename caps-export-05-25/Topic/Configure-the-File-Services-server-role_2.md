# Configure the File Services server role_2
You can deploy BranchCache file server\-based content servers on computers running [!INCLUDE[win8_server_2](../Token/win8_server_2_md.md)] and the File Services server role with the BranchCache for network files role service installed.  
  
-   To install a BranchCache content server on a computer that does not already have File Services installed, see [Install a New File Server as a Content Server](../Topic/Install-a-New-File-Server-as-a-Content-Server.md).  
  
-   To install a BranchCache content server on a computer that is already configured with the File Services server role, see [Configure an Existing File Server as a Content Server](../Topic/Configure-an-Existing-File-Server-as-a-Content-Server.md).
