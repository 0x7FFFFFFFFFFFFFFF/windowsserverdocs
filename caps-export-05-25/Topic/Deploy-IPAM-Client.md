# Deploy IPAM Client
At least one IPAM client is required to deploy and configure IPAM. In order for a computer to function as an IPAM client, it must be running [!INCLUDE[win8_server_1](../Token/win8_server_1_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[win8_client_1](../Token/win8_client_1_md.md)], or a later operating system.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> IPAM Client is installed by default on the same computer when you install IPAM Server.  It is not required to install an additional instance of IPAM Client unless you choose not to install IPAM Client on the same computer with IPAM Server.  
  
To connect to an IPAM server, a computer running IPAM Server must be present in the list of servers managed by Server Manager. It is not required for IPAM Client to be installed on the same computer with IPAM Server.  
  
## Installing IPAM Client  
For a list of tasks and procedures required to install IPAM Client, see [Checklist: Deploy IPAM Client](../Topic/Checklist--Deploy-IPAM-Client.md).
