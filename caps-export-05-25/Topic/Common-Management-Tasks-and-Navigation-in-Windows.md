# Common Management Tasks and Navigation in Windows
[!INCLUDE[winblue_server_1](../Token/winblue_server_1_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[winblue_client_1](../Token/winblue_client_1_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[win8_server_1](../Token/win8_server_1_md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[win8_client_1](../Token/win8_client_1_md.md)] feature the new Modern user interface. This topic helps you find and open common management tools, create shortcuts to frequently\-used programs, run programs with elevated user rights, and perform common tasks like signing in and out, restarting, and shutting down computers that are running [!INCLUDE[winblue_server_2](../Token/winblue_server_2_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[winblue_client_2](../Token/winblue_client_2_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[win8_server_2](../Token/win8_server_2_md.md)], or [!INCLUDE[win8_client_2](../Token/win8_client_2_md.md)].  
  
[!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_2](../Token/winthreshold_server_2_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_client_2](../Token/winthreshold_client_2_md.md)] include updates to the Modern user interface, such as the restoration of a **Start** menu that includes tool and app folders.  
  
You can install [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_2](../Token/winthreshold_server_2_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[winblue_server_2](../Token/winblue_server_2_md.md)], or [!INCLUDE[win8_server_2](../Token/win8_server_2_md.md)] with a minimal user interface that is well\-suited to remote management. For more information, see [Windows Server Installation Options](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh831786.aspx).

### <a name="BKMK_rdpkey"></a>Use keyboard shortcuts in a Remote Desktop session  
Before you connect to a Remote Desktop \(also known as RDP\) session, you can configure the session to accept Windows key combinations, whether the session is contained within a window, or occupies the full screen.  
  
##### To apply keyboard shortcuts to a Remote Desktop session  
  
1.  If the Remote Desktop Connection dialog box is not already open, open it by typing **mstsc** on the **Start** screen, and then pressing **Enter**.  
  
2.  On the Remote Desktop Connection dialog box, click **Show Options** to display connection setting tabs.  
  
3.  In the **Keyboard** area of the **Local Resources** tab, select one of the following from the **Apply Windows key combinations** drop\-down list.  
  
    -   To apply keyboard shortcuts to a full\-screen Remote Desktop session, select **Only when using the full screen**.  
  
    -   To apply keyboard shortcuts to a Remote Desktop session that is contained within a window, select **On the remote computer**.  
  
4.  When you are finished configuring other settings for your Remote Desktop session, click **Connect** to connect to the session and start working, or click **Save** on the **General** tab to save your connection settings as an RDP file that you can use for future connections.  
  
### <a name="BKMK_hypervkey"></a>Use keyboard shortcuts in Hyper\-V virtual machines  
Before you start a virtual machine connection, you can apply Windows key combinations to virtual machine connections on a physical host computer by editing the Hyper\-V settings for the physical computer in the Hyper\-V Manager console.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> The setting in this procedure is selected by default if the Hyper\-V host computer is running [!INCLUDE[winblue_server_2](../Token/winblue_server_2_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[win8_server_2](../Token/win8_server_2_md.md)]. If the host computer is running [!INCLUDE[winblue_client_2](../Token/winblue_client_2_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[win8_client_2](../Token/win8_client_2_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[nextref_server_7](../Token/nextref_server_7_md.md)], or [!INCLUDE[nextref_longhorn](../Token/nextref_longhorn_md.md)], you must change the setting to apply Windows key combinations to virtual machine connections.  
  
##### To apply keyboard shortcuts to new virtual machine connections  
  
1.  Open the Hyper\-V Manager snap\-in if it is not already open.  
  
    -   If you are running Remote Server Administration Tools for [!INCLUDE[winblue_client_2](../Token/winblue_client_2_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[win8_client_2](../Token/win8_client_2_md.md)], or you are running [!INCLUDE[winblue_server_2](../Token/winblue_server_2_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[win8_server_2](../Token/win8_server_2_md.md)], open [!INCLUDE[sm](../Token/sm_md.md)], and then open **Hyper\-V Manager** from the **Tools** menu in [!INCLUDE[sm](../Token/sm_md.md)].  
  
    -   On the **Start** screen, click **Hyper\-V Manager**.  
  
    -   If the Hyper\-V Manager tile is not on the **Start** screen, type all or part of the name, **Hyper\-V Manager** until the Hyper\-V Manager tile appears on the **Start** screen.  
  
2.  In the tree pane, right\-click the physical host computer, and then click **Hyper\-V Settings**.  
  
3.  In the **User** area of the navigation pane, click **Keyboard** to display keyboard shortcut settings.  
  
4.  Select **Use on the virtual machine** to allow new virtual machine connections to accept Windows key combinations from the physical computer. Click **OK** to save your changes and close the Hyper\-V Settings dialog box.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > This setting does not apply to virtual machine connections that are already open.
