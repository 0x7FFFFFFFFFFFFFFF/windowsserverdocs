# Understanding DNSSEC
DNSSEC is a suite of extensions that add security to the DNS protocol by enabling DNS responses to be validated. Specifically, DNSSEC provides origin authority, data integrity, and authenticated denial of existence. With DNSSEC, the DNS protocol is much less susceptible to certain types of attacks, particularly DNS spoofing attacks.  
  
The core DNSSEC extensions are specified in the following RFCs. Additional RFCs provide supporting information.  
  
-   [RFC 4033](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4033.txt): DNS Security Introduction and Requirements  
  
-   [RFC 4034](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4034.txt): Resource Records for the DNS Security Extensions  
  
-   [RFC 4035](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4035.txt): Protocol Modifications for the DNS Security Extensions
