# Step 4: Plan for OTP on the Remote Access Server_1
After planning for the one\-time password \(OTP\) RADIUS server and certificate settings, the final step in planning a Remote Access OTP deployment is to plan for client OTP settings on the Remote Access server.  
  
|Task|Description|  
|--------|---------------|  
|[4.1 Plan for OTP client exemptions](../Topic/Step-4--Plan-for-OTP-on-the-Remote-Access-Server_1.md#bkmk_4_1_Examptions)|Plan for exemptions for users that you do not require to authentication using OTP.|  
|[4.2 Plan for Windows 7 clients](../Topic/Step-4--Plan-for-OTP-on-the-Remote-Access-Server_1.md#bkmk_4_2_Win7)|Plan to deploy the DirectAccess Connectivity Assistant \(DCA\) 2.0 to [!INCLUDE[nextref_client_7](../Token/nextref_client_7_md.md)] client computers.|  
|[4.3 Plan for smart cards](../Topic/Step-4--Plan-for-OTP-on-the-Remote-Access-Server_1.md#BKMK_smartcard)|Plan for the use of smart cards for additional authorization.|  
  
## <a name="bkmk_4_1_Examptions"></a>4.1 Plan for OTP client exemptions  
When OTP authentication is enabled, by default all users are required to authenticate using a combination of user name and password, and OTP credentials. However, you can allow selected users to authenticate using a user name and password only, without OTP. To do this, create a security group and add any users that you want to exempt from OTP authentication.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Only client computers from a single forest may be exempted due to the fact that only one security group can be selected for client exemptions.  
  
## <a name="bkmk_4_2_Win7"></a>4.2 Plan for Windows 7 clients  
By default, [!INCLUDE[nextref_client_7](../Token/nextref_client_7_md.md)] client computers cannot authenticate using OTP. [!INCLUDE[nextref_client_7](../Token/nextref_client_7_md.md)] client computers require DCA 2.0 to authenticate using OTP in a [!INCLUDE[win8_server_2](../Token/win8_server_2_md.md)] Remote Access deployment. For more information about DCA 2.0, see [DirectAccess Connectivity Assistant 2.0](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=253699) on the Microsoft Download Center.  
  
## <a name="BKMK_smartcard"></a>4.3 Plan for smart cards  
When OTP authentication is enabled, the option to enable the use of smart cards for additional authorization is available. Create a security group to allow temporary access in the event that a userâ€™s smart card is not functional.
