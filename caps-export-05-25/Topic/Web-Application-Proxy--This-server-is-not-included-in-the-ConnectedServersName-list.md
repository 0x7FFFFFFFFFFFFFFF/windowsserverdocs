## Issue  
  
> *This server is not included in the ConnectedServersName list.*  
  
## Impact  
  
> *The Remote Access Management console may not work as expected.*  
  
## Resolution  
  
> *Use the Set\-WebApplicationProxyConfiguration cmdlet to add this server to the ConnectedServersName list.*  
  
All [!INCLUDE[adfs_webproxy](../Token/adfs_webproxy_md.md)] servers must be included in the ConnectedServersName list, otherwise they will not appear in the Remote Access Management console and attempts to change or configure published applications may result in unexpected behavior. You can manually configure the ConnectedServersName list only using [!INCLUDE[wps_2](../Token/wps_2_md.md)].

#### To add a server to the ConnectedServersName list  
  
1.  On the [!INCLUDE[adfs_webproxy](../Token/adfs_webproxy_md.md)] server, open a [!INCLUDE[wps_2](../Token/wps_2_md.md)] window.  
  
2.  Use the following command to view the current ConnectedServersName list:  
  
    ```  
    Get-WebApplicationProxyConfiguration  
    ```  
  
3.  Copy the current ConnectedServersName list to the clipboard.  
  
4.  Run the following command to add a server to the ConnectedServersName list:  
  
    ```  
    Set-WebApplicationProxyConfiguration â€“ConnectedServersName <paste-existing-list-here>,<new_server_name>.<domain_name>  
    ```  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > You must provide the existing list of connected servers, and then add each new server as a comma\-separated list for this command to be effective.
