# Datacenter Abstraction Layer (DAL) for Baseboard Management Controller (BMC)
This topic provides information about Data Abstraction Layer \(DAL\) for baseboard management controller \(BMC\).  
  
## DAL for BMC  
Insert section body here.  
  
### What is a BMC?  
A baseboard management controller \(BMC\) is a specialized service processor that is the intelligence in the Intelligent Platform Management Interface \(IPMI\) architecture. BMCs are used to monitor the physical state of network servers, computers, and other hardware devices. BMCs monitor a variety of sensors that are typically contained in the motherboards or main circuit boards of devices that are to be monitored. The sensors can monitor numerous system\-state variables, such as: power supply voltage, fan speed, temperature, humidity, and operating system \(OS\) status.  
  
If any of these variables are detected to be outside of the defined operating limits\-indicating a potential failure of the system\-the BMC sends an alert notification to the system administrator. If it is determined that the problem can be resolve by power cycling or restarting the system, the administrator, by remote control, can take corrections steps.
