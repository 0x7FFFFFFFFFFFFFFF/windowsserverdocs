# Manage User Accounts
This section describes the different types of user accounts, how to create user accounts, and how to manage user accounts. In a MultiPoint Services system, there are two types of user accounts, *standard user accounts* and *administrative user accounts*, as described below.  
  
> [!TIP]  
> The [User Account Considerations](../Topic/User-Account-Considerations.md) topic provides guidelines that you should consider as you create and manage user accounts.  
  
## Standard user accounts  
Create standard user accounts for those users, such as students, who will regularly access stations, but who will not manage stations. These user accounts display with the term **Standard** on the **Users** tab, in the **Account Type** column. Users with standard user accounts can, for example, save files and change desktop settings, but cannot change the screen resolution. Any desktop changes the user makes are present when the user logs on again. For information about how to create a standard user account, see the [Create a Standard User Account](../Topic/Create-a-Standard-User-Account.md) topic.  
  
## Administrative user accounts  
Create administrative user accounts for those individuals who will manage the MultiPoint Services system. Administrative user accounts are displayed with the term **Administrator** on the **Users** tab, in the **Account Type** column. *Administrative users* have access to all [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_manager](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_manager_md.md)] tasks that change desktop and system settings, and they have access to all other Windows tasks on the computer that require administrative access. The following administrative tasks can be performed by using [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_manager](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_manager_md.md)]:  
  
-   Creating accounts  
  
-   Adding and removing programs  
  
-   Managing desktops and hardware  
  
-   Ending or disconnecting other user sessions  
  
For more information about how to create administrative user accounts, see the [Create an Administrative User Account](../Topic/Create-an-Administrative-User-Account.md) topic.
