# Manually Configuring Managed Server Access Settings
If you have chosen the manual provisioning method in the Provision IPAM wizard, you must apply managed server access settings manually. You can apply access settings by manually applying IPAM provisioning GPOs, or by configuring access settings individually on each managed server.  
  
## Manually configuring managed server access settings  
Before you attempt to configure IPAM access settings manually on managed servers, review the following conceptual topics:  
  
-   [Getting Started with IPAM](../Topic/Getting-Started-with-IPAM.md)  
  
-   [IPAM Architecture](../Topic/IPAM-Architecture.md)  
  
-   [IPAM Deployment Planning](../Topic/IPAM-Deployment-Planning.md)  
  
After you have reviewed these topics, complete the following procedures to configure managed server access settings manually. Choose the procedure that corresponds to the server roles that will be managed by the IPAM server.  
  
-   [Manually Configure DHCP Access Settings](../Topic/Manually-Configure-DHCP-Access-Settings.md)  
  
-   [Manually Configure DNS Access Settings](../Topic/Manually-Configure-DNS-Access-Settings.md)  
  
-   [Manually Configure DC and NPS Access Settings](../Topic/Manually-Configure-DC-and-NPS-Access-Settings.md)
