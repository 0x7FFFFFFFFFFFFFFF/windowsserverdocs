# Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) for Network Access Overview
The Extensible Authentication Protocol \(EAP\) is an architectural framework that provides extensibility for authentication methods for commonly used protected network access technologies, such as IEEE 802.1X\-based wireless access, IEEE 802.1X\-based wired access, and Point\-to\-Point Protocol \(PPP\) connections such as Virtual Private Networking \(VPN\). EAP is not an authentication method like MS\-CHAP v2, but rather a framework on the access client and authentication server that allows networking vendors to develop and easily install new authentication methods known as EAP methods.  
  
For setting details about EAP, see [Extensible Authentication Protocol &#40;EAP&#41; Settings for Network Access](../Topic/Extensible-Authentication-Protocol--EAP--Settings-for-Network-Access.md).
