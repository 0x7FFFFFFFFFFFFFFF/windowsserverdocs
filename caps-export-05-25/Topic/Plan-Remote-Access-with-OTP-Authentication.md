# Plan Remote Access with OTP Authentication
[!INCLUDE[win8_server_2](../Token/win8_server_2_md.md)] combines DirectAccess and Routing and Remote Access Service \(RRAS\) VPN into a single Remote Access role. This overview provides an introduction to the planning steps required in order to deploy [!INCLUDE[win8_server_2](../Token/win8_server_2_md.md)] Remote Access with one\-time password \(OTP\) client authentication.  
  
-   [Step 1: Plan an Advanced Single Server Deployment_3](../Topic/Step-1--Plan-an-Advanced-Single-Server-Deployment_3.md). This step includes planning for the infrastructure required to deploy a single server. It includes planning for network and server settings, certificate requirements, DNS settings, network location server deployment, DirectAccess management servers, Active Directory settings, and Group Policy objects \(GPOs\).  
  
-   [Step 2: Plan the RADIUS Server Deployment_1](../Topic/Step-2--Plan-the-RADIUS-Server-Deployment_1.md).  
  
-   [Step 3: Plan OTP Certificate Deployment](../Topic/Step-3--Plan-OTP-Certificate-Deployment.md).  
  
-   [Step 4: Plan for OTP on the Remote Access Server_1](../Topic/Step-4--Plan-for-OTP-on-the-Remote-Access-Server_1.md)  
  
After you have completed these planning steps, see [Configure DirectAccess with OTP Authentication](../Topic/Configure-DirectAccess-with-OTP-Authentication.md). For information on configuring a multisite deployment as a proof of concept in a lab environment, see [Test Lab Guide: Demonstrate DirectAccess with OTP Authentication and RSA SecurID](../Topic/Test-Lab-Guide--Demonstrate-DirectAccess-with-OTP-Authentication-and-RSA-SecurID.md).
