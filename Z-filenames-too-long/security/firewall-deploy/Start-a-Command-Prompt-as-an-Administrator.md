# Start a Command Prompt as an Administrator
This topic describes how to open a command prompt with full administrator permissions. If your user account is a member of the Administrators group, but is not the Administrator account itself, then, by default, the programs that you run only have standard user permissions. You must explicitly specify that you require the use of your administrative permissions by using one of the procedures in this topic.

**Administrative credentials**

To complete these procedures, you must be a member of the Administrators group.

### To start a command prompt as an administrator

-   Right-click the **Start** charm, and then click **Command Prompt (Admin)**.

### To start a command prompt as an administrator (alternative method)

1.  Click the **Start** charm.

2.  Type **cmd**, right-click the **Command Prompt** tile, and then click **Run as administrator**.
