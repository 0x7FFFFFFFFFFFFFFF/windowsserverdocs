# Create a Rule to Permit or Deny Users Based on an Incoming Claim_1
Using the **Permit or Deny Users Based on an Incoming Claim** rule template in [!INCLUDE[firstref_adfs2](../Token/firstref_adfs2_md.md)], you can create an authorization rule that will grant or deny userâ€™s access to the relying party based on the type and value of an incoming claim. For example, you can use this rule template to create a rule that will permit only users that have a group claim with a value of Domain Admins to access the relying party. If you want to permit all users to access the relying party, use the **Permit All Users** rule template. Users who are permitted to access the relying party from the Federation Service may still be denied service by the relying party.  
  
You can use the following procedure to create a claim rule with the [!INCLUDE[nextref_adfs2](../Token/nextref_adfs2_md.md)] Management snap\-in.  
  
Membership in **Administrators**, or equivalent, on the local computer is the minimum required to complete this procedure. [!INCLUDE[review_details](../Token/review_details_md.md)]
