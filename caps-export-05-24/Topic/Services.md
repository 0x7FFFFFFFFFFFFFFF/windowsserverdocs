# Services
You can use the Services Microsoft Management Console \(MMC\) snap\-in to manage services that are running on local or remote computers — for example, to stop or start a service. You can also manage services using the **sc config** command.  
  
## What is a service?  
A service is an application type that runs in the system background without a user interface and is similar to a UNIX daemon process. Services provide core operating system features, such as Web serving, event logging, file serving, printing, cryptography, and error reporting.  
  
## What can I do with the Services snap\-in?  
You can perform the following actions for services on local and remote computers:  
  
-   Start, stop, pause, resume, or disable services.  
  
-   Set up recovery actions to take place if a service fails — for example, restarting the service automatically or restarting the computer.  
  
-   Run services in the security context of a user account that is different from the logged\-on user or the default computer account.  
  
-   Enable or disable services for a particular hardware profile.  
  
-   Export and save service information to a .txt or .csv file.  
  
-   View the status and description of each service.  
  
-   View the service dependencies.
