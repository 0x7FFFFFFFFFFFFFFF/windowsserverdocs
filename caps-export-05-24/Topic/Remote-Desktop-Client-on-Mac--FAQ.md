# Remote Desktop Client on Mac: FAQ
You can use the Remote Desktop client to connect to a remote PC and your work resources from almost anywhere. Experience rich interactivity using a remote desktop client designed to help you get your work done wherever you are. For example, you can connect to your work PC and have access to all of your apps, files, and network resources as if you were sitting right in front of your work PC. You can leave apps open at work and then see those same apps using the RD client.  
  
## Remote Desktop Client: FAQ  
You can use the RD Client to sit at a PC and connect to another PC in a different location \(the remote PC\). For example, you can connect to your work PC from your home PC and use all of your apps, files, and network resources as if you were sitting right in front of your work PC. You can leave apps open at work and then see those same apps on your home PC.

### Why can’t I connect using Remote Desktop Connection?  
Here are some possible solutions to common problems you might encounter when trying to connect to a remote PC. If these solutions don’t work, you can find more help on the [Microsoft Community](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=242079) website.  
  
-   **The remote PC can’t be found.** If you see this error, talk to the system admin of the remote PC to make sure you have the right PC name, and then check to see if you entered the name correctly. If you still can't connect, try entering the IP address of the remote PC instead of the PC name.  
  
-   **There’s a problem with the network.** Make sure that:  
  
    -   Your router is turned on \(home networks only\).  
  
    -   The Ethernet cable is plugged into your network adapter \(wired networks only\).  
  
    -   Your PC’s wireless switch is turned on \(laptops on wireless networks only\).  
  
    -   Your network adapter is working.  
  
    If the problem keeps happening, talk to the person who set up your network.  
  
-   **The Remote Desktop port might be blocked by a firewall.** If you're using Windows Firewall, follow these steps:  
  
    1.  Open Windows Firewall by swiping in from the right edge of the screen, tapping **Search** \(or if you're using a mouse, pointing to the upper\-right corner of the screen, moving the mouse pointer down, and then clicking **Search**\), entering **firewall** in the search box, tapping or clicking **Settings**, and then tapping or clicking **Windows Firewall**.  
  
    2.  Tap or click **Allow an app or feature through Windows Firewall**.  
  
    3.  Tap or click **Change settings**. You might be asked for an admin password or to confirm your choice.  
  
    4.  Under **Allowed apps and features**, select **Remote Desktop**, and then tap or click **OK**.  
  
    If you're using a different firewall, make sure the port for Remote Desktop \(usually 3389\) is open.  
  
-   **Remote connections might not be set up on the remote PC.** To fix this, see the "How do I set up a PC for Remote Desktop Connection?" question in this topic.  
  
-   **The remote PC might only allow PCs to connect that have Network Level Authentication set up.** For more info, see [What types of Remote Desktop connections should I allow?](http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-8/what-types-remote-desktop-connections)  
  
-   **The remote PC might be turned off.** You can’t connect to a PC that's turned off, asleep, or hibernating, so make sure the settings for sleep and hibernation on the remote PC are set to Never \(hibernation isn't available on all PCs.\). For more info, see [Power plans: Frequently asked questions.](http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-8/power-plans-faq)  
  
### Why can’t I sign in to a remote PC?  
If you can see the sign\-in screen of the remote PC but you can't sign in, you might not have been added to the Remote Desktop Users Group or to any group with administrator rights on the remote PC. Ask your system admin to do this for you.  
  
### Is retina resolution supported?  
Retina resolution is supported.  
  
### How do I enable secondary right\-click on your Mac?  
In order to make use of the right\-click inside an open session you have three options:  
  
-   Standard PC two button USB mouse  
  
-   Apple Magic Mouse: To enable right\-click, click**System Preferences** in the dock, click **Mouse**, and then enable **Secondary click**.  
  
-   Apple Magic Trackpad or MacBook Trackpad: To enable right\-click, click **System Preferences** in the dock, click **Mouse**, and then enable **Secondary click**.  
  
### How do I make use of all of my monitors?  
To enable the usage of two or more screens connected to your Mac follow these steps:  
  
-   Right\-click the Remote Desktop you want to enable multiple screens for, and then click **Edit**.  
  
-   Enable the options **Use all monitors** and **Full screen**.  
  
### How do I type various symbols on a Mac keyboard?  
The location of many symbols on your keyboard depends on the used keyboard layout and language setting.  
  
### I cannot find or connect to my computer  
Verify that your computer is on. You can either enter your computers IP address or host name.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Using the host name requires your network to resolve the host name properly through DNS. In many home network configurations only the IP address will work properly.  
  
Verify that you are connecting to a supported Windows version.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Windows XP Home, Windows Media Center Edition, Windows Vista Home and Windows 7 Home or Starter are not supported without 3rd party software.  
  
### VPN does not work  
These issues can have several reasons. For all reasons it is important to note, that if you can, please check that the VPN works on the same network from your PC or Mac. If you can't test from a PC or Mac you can try to access some company intranet webpage with your device's web browser and see if this works for at least a couple of minutes.  
  
-   **L2TP or PPTP VPNs:** If you are using L2TP or PPTP in your VPN, please set **Send All Traffic** to **ON** in the VPN configuration.  
  
-   **VPN is misconfigured:** A misconfigured VPN server can be the reason why the VPN connections never worked or stopped working after some time. Ensure testing with the iOS device's web browser or a PC or Mac on the same network if this happens.  
  
### Which connection methods are supported for company networks?  
If you want to access your office desktop from outside your company network, your company must provide you with a means of remote access. The RD Client currently supports the following:  
  
-   Terminal Server Gateway or Remote Desktop Gateway  
  
-   Remote Desktop Web Access  
  
-   VPN \(through iOS built\-in VPN options  
  
### Is bi\-directional sound supported?  
Sound upstream \(from client to server, for microphones\) is not supported by the Remote Desktop Client.  
  
### Why are the characters mixed up in the session?  
This issue can occur if the keyboard language has been switched on the remote PC while running a remote desktop session. In the case you would like to switch to a different keyboard language follow these instructions.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The remote PC selects the system language of the device running the remote desktop client and not the keyboard language. When switching the keyboard language on your device, you need to manually switch the keyboard language on the remote PC.  
  
1.  Open settings on your device.  
  
2.  Tap **General** and then tap **International**.  
  
3.  Tap **Language** and select the language running on the remote PC.  
  
4.  Open the RD Client and connect to the remote PC and check if the Windows keyboard language matches the language that you selected.  
  
### How to configure L2TP or PPTP VPN connections  
If you are using L2TP or PPTP in your VPN, please set **Send All Traffic** to **ON** in the VPN configuration.  
  
### Error: Insufficient privileges  
You are not allowed to access the session you want to connect to. The most likely cause is that you are trying to connect to an admin session. Only administrators are allowed to connect to the console. Verify that the console switch is off in the settings for the remote desktop. If this is not the source of the problem, please contact your system administrator for further assistance.  
  
### Error: Failed to parse NTLM challenge  
This error can be caused by a misconfiguration on the remote PC. Verify the RDP security level setting in the remote PC options is set to Client Compatible.  
  
### What can I do if the sound does not play?  
If sound doesn't play, log out of the session, not just disconnect, and log in again.  
  
### Unsupported Windows Versions and Editions  
The Remote Desktop Client will not connect to these Windows Versions and Editions:  
  
-   Windows XP Starter  
  
-   Windows XP Home  
  
-   Windows XP Tablet PC  
  
-   Windows Media Center  
  
-   Windows Vista Starter  
  
-   Windows Vista Home  
  
-   Windows 7 Starter  
  
-   Windows 7 Home  
  
If you want to access computers that have one of these Windows versions installed, we recommend you upgrade to a Windows version that supports RDP.  
  
### RD Gateway messaging is not supported  
Remote Desktop Client does not support RD Gateway messaging. Verify that the Remote Desktop Resource Access Policy \(RD RAP\) for your RD Gateway server does not specify **Only allow computers with support for RD Gateway Messaging** or you will not be able to connect.  
  
### ERROR: TS\_RAP "You are not allowed to connect to the given host ..."  
The error message “You are not allowed to connect to the given host through the gateway server because of a Resource Authorization Policy \(TS\_RAP\)” means that a Resource Authorization Policy on the Gateway server prevents your username from connecting to the remote PC. This could be the case:  
  
-   You have provided the same name for the remote PC as for the gateway.  
  
-   You are then trying to connect to the RD Gateway server itself which is probably not allowed for your username.  
  
-   Your Windows user account is not a member of the user groups for remote access on the Remote Desktop server.  
  
If you indeed want to connect to the gateway server itself via the gateway, do not use the external gateway name as PC name, use “localhost” or “127.0.0.1” or the internal server name for the remote desktop.  If the entries are correct, ask your system administrator to view the event log on the Terminal server and to check if your user account is a member of the required user groups.  
  
### Error message that there is no CAL  
When a remote desktop client connects to a Remote Desktop server, the server issues a Remote Desktop Services Client Access License \(RDS CAL\) stored by the client. Whenever the client connects again it will use its RDS CAL and the server will not issue another license. The server will issue another license if the RDS CAL on the device is missing or corrupt. When the maximum number of licensed devices is reached the server will not issue new RDS CALs. Contact your network administrator for assistance.  
  
### Error: Access Denied  
The "Access Denied" error is a generated by the Remote Desktop Gateway and the result of incorrect credentials during the connection attempt.  Verify your username and password.  If the connection worked before and the error occurred recently, you possibly changed your Windows user account password and haven't updated it yet in the remote desktop settings.  
  
### How can I test if VPN is working properly?  
Verify that VPN is enabled on your device. You can test your VPN connection by going to a webpage on your internal network or using a web service which is only available via the VPN.  
  
### Error: RPC Error 23014 or Error 0x59e6  
In case of an **RPC error 23014** or **Error 0x59E6 try again after waiting a few minutes**, the RD Gateway server has reached the maximum number of active connections.  Depending on the Windows version running on the RD Gateway the maximum number of connections differs: The Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard implementation limits the number of connections to 250. The Windows Server 2008 R2 Foundation implementation limits the number of connections to 50. All other Windows implementations allow an unlimited number of connections.
