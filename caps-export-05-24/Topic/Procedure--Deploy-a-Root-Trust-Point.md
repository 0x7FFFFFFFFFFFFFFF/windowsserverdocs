# Procedure: Deploy a Root Trust Point
Use the following procedures to deploy an Internet root \(.\) trust point.  
  
Do not use this procedure if your network uses a local DNS server as a root DNS server. Instead, use the procedures for importing or adding a trust point and specify the zone name to be the root zone \(.\). For more information, see [Procedure: Import a Trust Point](../Topic/Procedure--Import-a-Trust-Point.md) or [Procedure: Add a Trust Point](../Topic/Procedure--Add-a-Trust-Point.md).  
  
The following procedures are used to deploy a root trust anchor from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority \(IANA\) using the URL that is specified in the **RootTrustAnchorsURL** property of the DNS server. You can view the **RootTrustAnchorsURL** property by using the **Get\-DnsServerSetting** cmdlet. See the following example.  
  
```  
PS C:\> Get-DnsServerSetting -All | Select RootTrustAnchorsURL  
RootTrustAnchorsURL  
-------------------  
https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.xml  
```  
  
To modify the **RootTrustAnchorsURL** property, use the **Set\-DnsServerSetting** cmdlet.  
  
Procedures are provided using Windows PowerShell.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The **Root** parameter is not available for use with the **Add\-DnsServerTrustAnchor** cmdlet in [!INCLUDE[win8_server_2](../Token/win8_server_2_md.md)]. This parameter is new in [!INCLUDE[winblue_server_2](../Token/winblue_server_2_md.md)]. To deploy a root trust anchor on a DNS server running [!INCLUDE[win8_server_2](../Token/win8_server_2_md.md)], you can use the **Dnscmd.exe** utility \(for example, Dnscmd.exe \/RetrieveRootTrustAnchors.  
  
When you have completed the procedures in this topic, return to the parent checklist.  
  
## <a name="PS"></a>Deploy a root trust point using Windows PowerShell  
Membership in the **Administrators** group, or equivalent, is the minimum required to complete these procedures. [!INCLUDE[review_details](../Token/review_details_md.md)]  
  
To use the Windows PowerShell examples that are provided, replace server and zone names with the names you will use in your environment.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To add a root trust point, the computer must be connected to the Internet.  
  
#### To deploy a root trust point using Windows PowerShell  
  
1.  Open an elevated Windows PowerShell prompt on the resolving DNS server where you wish to add the root trust anchor.  
  
2.  To add a root trust anchor, use the **Add\-DnsServerTrustAnchor** cmdlet with the **Root** parameter. See the following example.  
  
    ```  
    PS C:\> Add-DnsServerTrustAnchor -Root  
    ```  
  
To verify that the root trust point was successfully added, you can use the **Get\-DnsServerTrustPoint** cmdlet. If you do not specify a value for the **Name** parameter, then all current trust points are displayed. See the following example.  
  
```  
PS C:\> Get-DnsServerTrustPoint  
  
TrustPointName                           TrustPointState      LastActiveRefreshTime     NextActiveRefreshTime  
--------------                           ---------------      ---------------------     ---------------------

```  
  
> [!WARNING]  
> If the status of a DS trust point is DS Pending, this means that the DNS server currently does not have access to the zoneâ€™s DNSKEY resource records. You might also need to verify that the DS trust point is current and uses a supported cryptographic algorithm.  
>   
> After adding a valid DS trust point, the DNS server will automatically acquire the current DNSKEY RRSET and use it to update the trust anchor.
