# 1 Summary
This document provides installation and validation guidance for Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview 3 (build \#10514) and System Center VMM 2016 for Guarded Fabric hosts and shielded VMs to enhance security of physical hosts and guest VMs.  
  
The goal of the Guarded Fabric solution is to help provide hosting service providers and private cloud operators the ability to offer their tenant administrators a hosted environment where protection for tenant virtual machine data is strengthened against threats from compromised storage, networks, host administrators, and malware. The focus of this preliminary release of Guarded Fabric and the deployment guide is to test a deployment of Guarded Fabric that can run *shielded virtual machines* (shielded VMs), which are encrypted. Guarded Fabric is intended to be used as part of your overall server security strategy.  
  
The primary users of this guide are hosting service providers or enterprise datacenter administrators. Using the information from this guide in your own infrastructure, you will test deploy guarded hosts in a fabric and run shielded VMs on these hosts.
