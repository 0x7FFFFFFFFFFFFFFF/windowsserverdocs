# Connection Manager Overview
You can use Connection Manager to connect to remote networks by using profiles configured and provided by your network administrator. Most of the required configuration that you need to connect is contained in the profile; you supply your network credentials. Connection Manager also supports virtual private network \(VPN\) connections over the Internet by using your broadband network connection or a dial\-up modem. For dial\-up users, the administrator can provide a phone book with a list of available numbers, allowing you to simply select the best phone number for your current location.  
  
For network administrators, you can use the Connection Manager Administration Kit to create profiles you can distribute to your users.  
  
The documentation for Connection Manager has not been updated for this version of Windows. You can find the documentation for Connection Manager at [Connection Manager](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=236108) in the Windows Server TechCenter.
