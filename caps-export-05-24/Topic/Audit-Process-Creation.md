# Audit Process Creation
This topic for the IT professional describes the Advanced Security Audit policy setting, **Audit Process Creation**, which determines whether the operating system generates audit events when a process is created \(starts\).  
  
These audit events can help you track user activity and understand how a computer is being used. Information includes the name of the program or the user that created the process.  
  
Event volume: Low to medium, depending on system usage  
  
Default: Not configured  
  
If this policy setting is configured, the following events appear on computers running the supported versions of the Windows operating system as designated in the **Applies To** list at the beginning of this topic, in addition to Windows ServerÂ 2008 and Windows Vista.  
  
|Event ID|Event message|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|4688|A new process has been created.|  
|4696|A primary token was assigned to a process.|
