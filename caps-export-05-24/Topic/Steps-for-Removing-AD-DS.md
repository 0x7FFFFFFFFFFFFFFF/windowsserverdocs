# Steps for Removing AD DS
  The following sections provide step\-by\-step instructions for removing Active Directory Domain Services \(AD DS\) in all configurations, including methods for removing the server role on both a full installation and a Server Core installation. These instructions apply to [!INCLUDE[nextref_longhorn](../Token/nextref_longhorn_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nextref_server_7](../Token/nextref_server_7_md.md)]. These methods use the Windows interface, an answer file, and the command line.  
  
 The unattended methods of removing AD DS are required for Server Core installations. The process for performing an unattended removal of AD DS is the same for a server that is running a full installation or a Server Core installation.  
  
 Procedures for removing AD DS are provided for the following scenarios:  
  
-   [Removing a Domain Controller from a Domain](../Topic/Removing-a-Domain-Controller-from-a-Domain.md)  
  
-   [Removing the Last Domain Controller in a Domain](../Topic/Removing-the-Last-Domain-Controller-in-a-Domain.md)  
  
-   [Removing the Last Domain Controller in a Forest](../Topic/Removing-the-Last-Domain-Controller-in-a-Forest.md)
