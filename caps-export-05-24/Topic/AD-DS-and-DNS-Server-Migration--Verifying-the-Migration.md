# AD DS and DNS Server Migration: Verifying the Migration
    
## Verify the destination server configuration  
 After the migration of Active Directory Domain Services \(AD DS\) Server is complete, you can perform some tasks to verify that the migration was successful. A successful migration is defined in “Impact of migration” in [Active Directory Domain Services and DNS Server Migration Guide](../Topic/Active-Directory-Domain-Services-and-DNS-Server-Migration-Guide.md). When the migration is successful:  
  
-   The destination server takes over all roles and responsibilities of the source server.  
  
-   Users, computers, and applications are not affected by the server change.  
  
-   End users are not required to change the client configuration in any way.  
  
 After your AD DS Server migration is complete, verify that everything is functioning correctly on the destination server. If there are any issues during testing, make sure that you troubleshoot and resolve them before you demote and disconnect the source server. Your testing should verify the items in the worksheet in [AD DS and DNS Server Migration: Appendix B - Migration Verification Worksheet](../Topic/AD-DS-and-DNS-Server-Migration--Appendix-B---Migration-Verification-Worksheet.md).
