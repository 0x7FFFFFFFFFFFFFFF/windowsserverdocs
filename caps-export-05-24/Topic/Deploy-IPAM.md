# Deploy IPAM
IP Address Management is a built\-in framework provided in [!INCLUDE[win8_server_1](../Token/win8_server_1_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[winblue_server_1](../Token/winblue_server_1_md.md)] for discovering, monitoring, auditing, and managing the IP address space used on a corporate network. With IPAM, you can gain visibility and control over all aspects of your IP address infrastructure from a single console.  
  
## About this guide  
This guide is intended for use by system administrators and system engineers. It provides detailed guidance for deploying IPAM Server and IPAM Client based on a design that has been chosen. If your organization has not yet selected a design, see [IPAM Deployment Planning](../Topic/IPAM-Deployment-Planning.md). You can then use this guide to deploy IPAM in your production environment.  
  
This guide provides steps for deploying IPAM using a distributed, centralized, or hybrid design using a Group Policy based or manual provisioning method.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You can use the procedures in this guide for deploying IPAM with any version of Windows Server that supports this feature. Changes to procedures and new procedures that are required for specific operating system versions are noted in the guide where applicable.  For detailed information about new and updated features in IPAM that are available in different versions of Windows Server, see [What's New in IPAM \[redirected\]](assetId:///7c63bdb6-af0f-4fbf-ace9-10b807bfeede).  
  
Use the checklists in [Implement Your IPAM Design Plan](../Topic/Implement-Your-IPAM-Design-Plan.md) to determine how best to use the instructions in this guide to deploy a particular design and provisioning method. For information about hardware and software requirements for deploying IPAM, see the Hardware and software requirements section in the IPAM Deployment Planning topic.
