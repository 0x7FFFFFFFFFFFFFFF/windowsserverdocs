# Configuring Domain and Forest Trusts
  You can remove manually created trusts, but you cannot remove the default, two\-way, transitive trusts between domains in a forest. If you remove manually created trusts, it is particularly important to verify that you successfully removed the trusts if you are planning to re\-create them.  
  
 This section includes the following tasks for removing a manually created trust:  
  
-   [Validating and Removing Trusts](../Topic/Validating-and-Removing-Trusts.md)  
  
-   [Modifying Name Suffix Routing Settings](../Topic/Modifying-Name-Suffix-Routing-Settings.md)
