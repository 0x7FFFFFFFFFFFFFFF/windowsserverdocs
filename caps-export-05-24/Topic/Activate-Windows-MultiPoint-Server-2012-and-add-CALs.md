# Activate Windows MultiPoint Server 2012 and add CALs
To enable users to use stations in [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_2](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_2_md.md)], you must obtain and install a Client Access License \(CAL\) for each station. If you're using an evaluation version of [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_2](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_2_md.md)], you might need to activate MultiPoint Server before proceeding.  
  
## Activate an evaluation version of [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_2](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_2_md.md)]  
If you are using an evaluation version of [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_2](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_2_md.md)], you might need to activate MultiPoint Server before obtaining CALs. You can use your evaluation version for 180 days before activation is required. At that point, you must purchase the released version of Windows MultiPoint Server to continue using your system. After you purchase the released version, you can use the product key from the Volume Licensing Service Center or your reseller to convert your evaluation setup to the full released product.  
  
You can activate your MultiPoint Server system online or by phone.  
  
#### To activate an evaluation version of MultiPoint Server online  
  
1.  From the **Start** screen, type **Activation**, and then click **Windows Activation** in the results.  
  
2.  Click **Activate with a new key**.  
  
3.  Enter your new product key as instructed, and click **OK**.  
  
For more information about activation, search for **What is activation** in Windows Help and Support. \(To open Windows Help and Support, hold down the Windows key, and press F1.\)  
  
## Add a client access license \(CAL\) for each station  
You must obtain a client access license \(CAL\) for each station that is connected to the computer running [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_2](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_2_md.md)] and then install the CALs in MultiPoint Server. If you are using station virtual desktops instead of physical stations, you must install a CAL for each station virtual desktop.  
  
#### To add client access licenses \(CALs\) in [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_2](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_2_md.md)]  
  
1.  Purchase a client license for each station that is connected to your Windows MultiPoint 2012 computer. For more information about purchasing CALs, see [How to Buy MultiPoint Server](../Topic/How-to-Buy-MultiPoint-Server.md) \(http:\/\/technet.microsoft.com\/library\/jj916397.aspx\).  
  
2.  From the **Start** screen, open **MultiPoint Manager**.  
  
3.  Click the **Home** tab, and then click **Add client access licenses**.  
  
4.  Follow the instructions in the wizard to add the CALs.  
  
For more information about managing CALs, see [Add or Remove Client Access Licenses](../Topic/Add-or-Remove-Client-Access-Licenses.md) in Windows MultiPoint Manager Help.
