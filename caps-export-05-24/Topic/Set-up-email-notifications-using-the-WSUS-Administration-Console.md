# Set up email notifications using the WSUS Administration Console
You can configure [!INCLUDE[wsus_firstref_30SP2](../Token/wsus_firstref_30SP2_md.md)] 3.0Â SP2 to send status reports and email notifications about new updates. Update notifications are sent every time that the WSUS server synchronizes new updates. Status reports can be sent daily or weekly. Email notifications do not include rolled\-up computer status data from replica servers.

3.  In the **Options** pane, click **E\-Mail Notifications**.  
  
4.  On the **General** tab, select the **Send e\-mail notification when new updates are synchronized** check box and configure the following settings:  
  
    1.  In the **Recipients**field, type the email addresses of the people who should receive update notifications. Separate the names with semicolons.  
  
    2.  To set up status reports, select the **Send status reports** check box.  
  
    3.  In the **Frequency** field, select **Daily** or **Weekly**.  
  
    4.  In the **Send reports at** field, set the time at which you want status reports to be sent.  
  
    5.  In the **Recipients** field type the email addresses of the people who should receive status reports, delimited by semicolons.  
  
    6.  Select the language in which the status reports should be sent from the **Language** drop\-down menu.  
  
5.  Click **Apply** to save these settings.  
  
6.  Click the **E\-Mail Server** tab and configure the following settings:  
  
    1.  In the **Outgoing email server \(SMTP\)** field, type the name of the SMTP server.

    3.  In the **Sender name** field, type the sender's email display name. This is typically the name of the WSUS administrator.  
  
    4.  In the **Email address** field, type the sender's email address.  
  
    5.  If the SMTP server requires logon information, select the **My SMTP server requires authentication** check box.  
  
    6.  Enter the required logon user name and password in the respective boxes.  
  
        > [!NOTE]
