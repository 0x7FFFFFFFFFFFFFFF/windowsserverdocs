# Enable file sharing in Windows MultiPoint Server 2012
You can allow users on your [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_2](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_2_md.md)] stations to share files in two ways:  
  
-   **If you have a file server on the network,** it is recommended that you create a shared folder on the file server.  
  
-   **If you have a small network of 2\-3 MultiPoint Server computers, with no dedicated file server,** one of the MultiPoint Server computers can act as the file server for all the MultiPoint Server computers. Create a shared folder on that computer, and then create local user accounts for all users on that computer. The shared folder can be on the original internal drive, or you can attach additional internal or external drives to the computer.
