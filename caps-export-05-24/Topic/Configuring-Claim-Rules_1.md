# Configuring Claim Rules_1
In a claims\-based identity model, the function of [!INCLUDE[firstref_adfs2](../Token/firstref_adfs2_md.md)] as federation services is to issue a token that contains a set of claims. Claims rules govern the decision in regard of claims that [!INCLUDE[nextref_adfs2](../Token/nextref_adfs2_md.md)] issues. Claim rules and all server configuration data are stored in the [!INCLUDE[nextref_adfs2](../Token/nextref_adfs2_md.md)] configuration database.  
  
[!INCLUDE[nextref_adfs2](../Token/nextref_adfs2_md.md)] makes issuance decisions that are based on identity information that is provided to it in the form of claims and other contextual information. At a high level, [!INCLUDE[nextref_adfs2](../Token/nextref_adfs2_md.md)] operates as a rules processor by taking one set of claims as input, performs a number of transformations, and then returns a different set of claims as output.
