# Prepare your Windows MultiPoint Server 2012 system for users
After you install and configure [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_2](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_2_md.md)], and perform any additional configuration and hardware setups, you are ready to give users access to the system. You will need to plan and create user accounts. In some environments, you also need to configure stations for auto\-logon and allow multiple sessions for your shared user accounts. And you need to decide how to set up file sharing for your users. All of these topics are covered in this section.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> After you create your user accounts and make the other configuration updates to prepare for users, we recommend that you turn on Disk Protection so that no user can inadvertently make changes to system files and settings. For more information, see [Configure Disk Protection in Windows MultiPoint Server 2012](../Topic/Configure-Disk-Protection-in-Windows-MultiPoint-Server-2012.md).
