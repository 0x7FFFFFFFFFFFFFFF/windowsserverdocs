# Plan Deployment for Remote Management of DirectAccess Clients_1
[!INCLUDE[remote_access_combo](../Token/remote_access_combo_md.md)]  
  
The following topics provide planning steps for deploying a single Remote Access server running [!INCLUDE[win8_server_2](../Token/win8_server_2_md.md)] that can be used for remote management of DirectAccess clients.  
  
[Step 1: Plan the Remote Access Infrastructure](../Topic/Step-1--Plan-the-Remote-Access-Infrastructure.md): This topic helps you plan the network topology and server settings, firewall requirements, certificate requirements, Domain Name System requirements, DirectAccess network location server and management servers’ configuration, Active Directory requirements, and Group Policy Object creation.  
  
[Step 2: Plan the Remote Access Deployment_1](../Topic/Step-2--Plan-the-Remote-Access-Deployment_1.md): Plan client and server deployment strategies and  infrastructure servers’ configurations.  
  
## Next steps  
After you complete these planning steps, you can begin the server deployment. For instructions, see [Install and Configure Deployment for Remote Management of DirectAccess Clients_1](../Topic/Install-and-Configure-Deployment-for-Remote-Management-of-DirectAccess-Clients_1.md).
