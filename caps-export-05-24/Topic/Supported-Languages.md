# Supported Languages
[!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_3](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_3_md.md)] supports multilanguage installations. This means that each user can choose a preferred language for the desktop. This is a per\-user setting, so even if a station is shared by multiple users, when a user logs on, the selected language will appear. This will apply no matter which station is accessed by that user.  
  
[!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_2](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_2_md.md)] supports all the language packs that are available for Windows ServerÂ 2012. The languages that are available for individual \(end\) users are as follows:  
  
Arabic, Bulgarian, Chinese Traditional, Chinese Simplified, Chinese HK, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch,  English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese \(Brazil\), Portuguese \(Portugal\), Romanian, Russian, Serbian Latin, Slovakian, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, Thai, Ukrainian.
