# IPAM Virtual IP Address Space
This topic provides a summary of role based access control for IP Address Management \(IPAM\), a new feature available in [!INCLUDE[winblue_server_1](../Token/winblue_server_1_md.md)].  
  
More information and links will be provided in this topic when available.  
  
## <a name="VASM"></a>Virtual address space management  
IPAM offers a unified, centralized administrative experience for network administrators to manage IP address space on a corporate network and in Microsoft\-powered cloud networks. IPAM enables network administrators to completely streamline the IP address space administration of both physical \(fabric\) and virtual networks. The integration between IPAM and [!INCLUDE[vmmblue_1](../Token/vmmblue_1_md.md)] provides end\-to\-end IP address space automation for Microsoft\-powered cloud networks. IPAM integration with [!INCLUDE[vmmblue_2](../Token/vmmblue_2_md.md)] enables a single IPAM server to detect and prevent IP address space conflicts, duplicates, and overlaps across multiple instances of [!INCLUDE[vmmblue_2](../Token/vmmblue_2_md.md)] deployed in the large datacenter.  
  
To view virtual address space in IPAM, click the new **VIRTUALIZED ADDRESS SPACE** node in the upper navigation pane of the IPAM console.
