# Select WSUS update products and classifications filters using the WSUS Administration Console
You can specify the Microsoft software products for which you want to manage updates, and you can filter updates by update classifications. For more information about these options, see [Plan for WSUS product and classification updates](assetId:///1e07020b-ce47-4b01-a745-71f9c0b607dd).  
  
You can configure these settings at any time by using the WSUS Administration Console.  
  
### To specify products or classification filters  
  
1.  [Open the WSUS Administration Console](../Topic/Configure-WSUS-by-Using-the-WSUS-Administration-Console.md#opencon).  
  
2.  In the left pane of the WSUS Administration Console, expand the server name, and then click **Options**.  
  
3.  In the **Options** pane, click **Products and Classifications**.  
  
4.  To select the Microsoft products for which you want to manage updates, click the **Products** tab.  
  
    1.  Select the check box for each product category or product for which you want to manage updates. To remove a product from selection, clear the check box for that product.  
  
    2.  Click **OK**.  
  
5.  To filter updates by classification, click the **Classifications** tab.  
  
    1.  Select the check box for each type of update that you want to manage. By default, **Critical Updates**, **Definition Updates**, and **Security Updates** are selected. To manage all updates, select the check box for **All Classifications**.  
  
    2.  Click **OK**.
