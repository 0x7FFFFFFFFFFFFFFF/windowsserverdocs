# Manage Role Based Access Control with Server Manager
You can use the following topics to manage role based access control by using Server Manager, which has a graphical user interface.  
  
-   [Create a User Role for Access Control](../Topic/Create-a-User-Role-for-Access-Control.md)  
  
-   [Create an Access Policy](../Topic/Create-an-Access-Policy.md)  
  
-   [Set Access Scope for a DNS Zone](../Topic/Set-Access-Scope-for-a-DNS-Zone.md)  
  
-   [Set Access Scope for DNS Resource Records](../Topic/Set-Access-Scope-for-DNS-Resource-Records.md)  
  
-   [View Roles and Role Permissions](../Topic/View-Roles-and-Role-Permissions.md)  
  
Alternately, you can use Windows PowerShell to manage IPAM role based access control. For more information, see [Manage Role Based Access Control with Windows PowerShell](../Topic/Manage-Role-Based-Access-Control-with-Windows-PowerShell.md).
