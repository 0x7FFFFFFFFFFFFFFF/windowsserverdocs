# Install and Configure Content Servers_1
When you deploy BranchCache in distributed cache mode or hosted cache mode, you must deploy one or more content servers at your main office. Content servers that are Web servers or application servers use the BranchCache feature. Content servers that are file servers use the **BranchCache for network files** role service of the File Services server role in [!INCLUDE[win8_server_2](../Token/win8_server_2_md.md)].  
  
See the following topics to deploy content servers.  
  
-   [Install Content Servers that Use the BranchCache Feature](../Topic/Install-Content-Servers-that-Use-the-BranchCache-Feature.md)  
  
-   [Install File Services Content Servers](../Topic/Install-File-Services-Content-Servers.md)
