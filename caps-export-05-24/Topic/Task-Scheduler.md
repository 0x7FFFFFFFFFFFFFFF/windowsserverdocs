# Task Scheduler
The Task Scheduler MMC snap\-in helps you schedule automated tasks that perform actions at a specific time or when a certain event occurs. It maintains a library of all scheduled tasks, providing an organized view of the tasks and a convenient point of access for managing them. From within the library, you can run, disable, modify, and delete tasks. The Task Scheduler user interface \(UI\) is an MMC snap\-in that replaces the Scheduled Tasks Explorer extension in Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and Windows 2000.  
  
For more information about using the Task Scheduler, see [Task Scheduler How To](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc766428.aspx).
