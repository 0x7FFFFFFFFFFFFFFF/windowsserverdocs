# Connection Manager Administration Kit Overview
Connection Manager is a client network connection tool that allows a user to connect to a remote network, such as an Internet service provider \(ISP\), or a corporate network protected by a virtual private network \(VPN\) server.  
  
The Connection Manager Administration Kit \(CMAK\) is a tool that you can use to customize the remote connection experience for users on your network by creating predefined connections to remote servers and networks. To create and customize a connection for your users, you use the CMAK wizard.  
  
The documentation for the Connection Manager Administration Kit has not been updated for this version of Windows. You can find the documentation at [Connection Manager Administration Kit](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=236790) in the Windows Server TechCenter.
