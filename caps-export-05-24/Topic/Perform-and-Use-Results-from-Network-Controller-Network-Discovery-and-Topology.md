# Perform and Use Results from Network Controller Network Discovery and Topology
This guide provides information about  the Network Controller feature Network Discovery and Topology, including learning how to perform Network Discovery and use the topology results.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Before you perform Network Discovery, it is recommended that you review the following Network Discovery and Topology topics.  
>   
> -   [Network Discovery and Topology](../Topic/Network-Discovery-and-Topology.md)  
> -   [Network Discovery and Topology Terminology](../Topic/Network-Discovery-and-Topology-Terminology.md)  
> -   [Network Elements Discovered by Network Controller](../Topic/Network-Elements-Discovered-by-Network-Controller.md)  
  
To perform and use results from Network Discovery and Topology, perform the steps in the following ordered topics.  
  
1.  [Prerequisites for Performing Network Discovery](../Topic/Prerequisites-for-Performing-Network-Discovery.md)  
  
2.  [Perform Network Discovery](../Topic/Perform-Network-Discovery.md)  
  
3.  [View and Validate Discovered Topology](../Topic/View-and-Validate-Discovered-Topology.md)  
  
4.  [Compare the Discovered Topology with the Actual Topology](Compare-the-Discovered-Topology-with-the-Actual-Topology.md)  
  
5.  [Modify the Discovered Topology](Modify-the-Discovered-Topology.md)  
  
6.  [View Network Discovery Statistics](../Topic/View-Network-Discovery-Statistics.md)  
  
7.  [Use Vicinity View for a Topology Node](../Topic/Use-Vicinity-View-for-a-Topology-Node.md)  
  
8.  [Build the Actual Topology in Network Controller](../Topic/Build-the-Actual-Topology-in-Network-Controller.md)  
  
9. [Convert the Discovered Topology into the Actual Topology](Convert-the-Discovered-Topology-into-the-Actual-Topology.md)
