# Define Display Settings
The screen resolution should be set according to the hardware that is attached to the server. For optimal display of the Dashboard, a setting of 1024 x 768 or greater is required. For more information about setting the screen resolution, see the [Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=248694) documentation.
