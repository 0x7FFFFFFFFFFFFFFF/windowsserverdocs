# Customize Storage Spaces
To preconfigure Storage Spaces for a better user experience, you can run the Storage Spaces configuration script from PostIC.cmd. The Storage Spaces configuration script must be run on the target computer, after you have completed the [!INCLUDE[sbs_sbs8web_2](../Token/sbs_sbs8web_2_md.md)] installation. For more information about scripts that automate Storage Spaces management tasks, see [Deploy and Manage Storage Spaces with PowerShell](http://www.microsoft.com/download/confirmation.aspx?id=30125).
