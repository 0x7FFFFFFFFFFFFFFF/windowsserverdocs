# Manage IPAM
This guide provides administration and troubleshooting information for the IP Address Management \(IPAM\) feature in [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_1](../Token/winthreshold_server_1_md.md)].  
  
In [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_2](../Token/winthreshold_server_2_md.md)], IPAM supports DNS resource record, conditional forwarder, and DNS zone management for both domain\-joined Active Directory\-integrated and file\-backed DNS servers. In addition, IPAM supports role\-based access control and all functionality in previous versions of the technology.  
  
This guide includes the following sections:  
  
-   [DNS Resource Record Management](../Topic/DNS-Resource-Record-Management.md)  
  
-   [DNS Zone Management](../Topic/DNS-Zone-Management.md)  
  
-   [Manage Resources in Multiple Active Directory Forests](../Topic/Manage-Resources-in-Multiple-Active-Directory-Forests.md)  
  
-  [Purge Utilization Data](Purge-Utilization-Data.md)  
  
-   [Role-based Access Control](../Topic/Role-based-Access-Control.md)
