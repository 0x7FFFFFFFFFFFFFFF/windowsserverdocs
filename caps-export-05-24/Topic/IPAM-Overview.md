# IPAM Overview
IPAM in [!INCLUDE[win8_server_1](../Token/win8_server_1_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[winblue_server_1](../Token/winblue_server_1_md.md)] is a new built\-in framework for discovering, monitoring, auditing, and managing the IP address space used on a corporate network. IPAM provides for administration and monitoring of servers running Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol \(DHCP\) and Domain Name System \(DNS\).  
  
For more information, see [IP Address Management \(IPAM\) Overview](../Topic/IP-Address-Management--IPAM--Overview.md).
