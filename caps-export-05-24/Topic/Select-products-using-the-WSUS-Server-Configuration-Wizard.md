# Select products using the WSUS Server Configuration Wizard
On the **Choose Products** page of the WSUS server configuration wizard, you can specify the Microsoft software products for which you want to manage updates. You can select product categories, such as **Windows**, or specific products in a category, such as **Windows 7**. If you select a product category, all products in that category are automatically selected. You can then remove individually selected products in a category.  
  
By default, all products in the **Office** and **Windows** product categories are selected.

1.  Select the check box for each product category or product for which you want to manage updates. To remove a product from selection, clear the check box for that product.
