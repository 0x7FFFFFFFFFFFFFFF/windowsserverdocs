# Manage User Desktops Using MultiPoint Dashboard
In a MultiPoint Services system, a desktop is the software user interface presented on the monitor for each user *station*. The [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_dashboard](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_dashboard_md.md)] is a tool which helps you manage those desktops.   
  
In [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_dashboard](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_dashboard_md.md)], on the **Home** tab, you can do the following:  
  
### View desktops  
You can view the thumbnail images for each active desktop. For information about viewing thumbnails, see the [View and Change the Display Size of Desktop Images in MultiPoint Dashboard](../Topic/View-and-Change-the-Display-Size-of-Desktop-Images-in-MultiPoint-Dashboard.md) topic.  
  
### Block or unblock stations  
You can block and unblock stations. You can also customize a message to display on blocked stations. For more information about blocking or unblocking stations, or creating a message to display on blocked stations, see the [Block or Unblock a Station](../Topic/Block-or-Unblock-a-Station.md) topic.  
  
### Limit web use  
You can configure which websites users can visit. For information about setting websites, see the [Limit Web Access](../Topic/Limit-Web-Access.md) topic.  
  
### Block or unblock USB storage  
You can block and unblock USB storage either per station or for all station. When storage is blocked, users cannot use any USB storage devices on their stations. See the [Block or Unblock USB Storage](Block-or-Unblock-USB-Storage.md) topic.  
  
### Project a station to another station  
You can project your station to another station or stations. You can also project a different selected station to all other stations. For information about projecting a station, see the [Project a Station to Other Stations](../Topic/Project-a-Station-to-Other-Stations.md) topic.  
  
### Launch or close applications on a station  
You can launch or close applications on a station. For information about launching or closing applications, see the [Launch or Close Applications on a Station](../Topic/Launch-or-Close-Applications-on-a-Station.md) topic.  
  
### Chat with a user (IM)  
You can chat with selected users. The chat message is only visible to the Dashboard user and the user of the selected session. See the IM topic for more information.  
  
### Change the size of thumbnail images  
You can change the size of the thumbnails that display in [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_dashboard](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_dashboard_md.md)]. For information about changing the thumbnail size, see [Change Thumbnail Size](assetId:///7e9f71ec-c012-4e3c-a5b2-958d23b8b12f)  
  
### Show all stations  
You can view all of the stations that are connected to your system, including stations that are not active. For information about viewing all stations, see the [Show All Stations](../Topic/Show-All-Stations.md) topic.  
  
### Search and sort thumbnails  
You can define the order and grouping of thumbnails in the dashboard. Use search to filter the thumbnails.  
  
### Log off all monitored stations  
You can log off all of the monitored stations on your MultiPoint Services system. For information about logging off monitored stations, see the [Log Off User Sessions](../Topic/Log-Off-User-Sessions.md) topic.
