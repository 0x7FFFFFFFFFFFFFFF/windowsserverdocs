# Shutdown Event Tracker
Shutdown Event Tracker records the reason why you shut down or restart a computer so that system administrators can review the data later. System administrators can require that you provide this information when you shut down or restart the computer, or that you provide information when you are the first user to sign in to the computer after an unexpected restart or shutdown.  
  
For detailed information on how to use Shutdown Event Tracker, see [Work with Shutdown Event Tracker](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc772534.aspx).  
  
You can also provide a reason why you shut down or restart a computer when you use the **shutdown** command. For more information, see [Shutdown](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=244423) in the Windows Server Technical Library.
