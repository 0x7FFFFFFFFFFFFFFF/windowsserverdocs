# Step 1: Plan an Advanced Single-Server Deployment_2
The first step in planning a [!INCLUDE[win8_server_1](../Token/win8_server_1_md.md)] Remote Access load\-balanced cluster is to plan and configure an advanced single server deployment.  
  
## Plan a single server deployment  
Before you deploy a Remote Access load\-balanced cluster, make sure that you have completed all the planning steps to deploy a single Remote Access server. See [Plan an Advanced DirectAccess Deployment_1](../Topic/Plan-an-Advanced-DirectAccess-Deployment_1.md). Then continue to [Step 2: Plan Cluster Servers_1](../Topic/Step-2--Plan-Cluster-Servers_1.md).
