# Using a SQL Server Database with IPAM
This topic provides a summary of how to use a SQL server database with IPAM, which is a new capability of IPAM available in [!INCLUDE[winblue_server_1](../Token/winblue_server_1_md.md)].  
  
More information and links will be provided in this topic when available.  
  
## <a name="DB"></a>External database support for IPAM  
During the IPAM provisioning process in [!INCLUDE[winblue_server_2](../Token/winblue_server_2_md.md)], you have the option of choosing a Windows Internal Database \(WID\) or Microsoft SQL Server for the IPAM database. With Microsoft SQL Server, the IPAM database can be collocated on the IPAM server, or it can be located on a remote computer. Support for SQL enables additional scalability, disaster recovery, and reporting scenarios.
