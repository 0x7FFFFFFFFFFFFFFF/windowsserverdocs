# Identifying Your AD FS Deployment Goals
Correctly identifying your [!INCLUDE[firstref_adfs2](../Token/firstref_adfs2_md.md)] deployment goals is essential for the success of your [!INCLUDE[nextref_adfs2](../Token/nextref_adfs2_md.md)] design project. Depending on the size of your organization and the level of involvement that you want to provide for the information technology \(IT\) staff in any partner organizations, form a project team that can clearly articulate real\-world deployment issues in a vision statement. Make sure that the members of this team understand the direction in which your deployment project must move in order to reach your [!INCLUDE[nextref_adfs2](../Token/nextref_adfs2_md.md)] deployment goals.  
  
When you write your vision statement, identify, clarify, and refine your deployment goals. Prioritize and, possibly, combine your deployment goals so that you can design and deploy [!INCLUDE[nextref_adfs2](../Token/nextref_adfs2_md.md)] by using an iterative approach. You can take advantage of existing, documented, and predefined [!INCLUDE[nextref_adfs2](../Token/nextref_adfs2_md.md)] deployment goals that are relevant to the [!INCLUDE[nextref_adfs2](../Token/nextref_adfs2_md.md)] designs and develop a working solution for your situation.  
  
The following table lists the tasks for articulating, refining, and documenting your [!INCLUDE[nextref_adfs2](../Token/nextref_adfs2_md.md)] deployment goals.  
  
|Task|Reference links|  
|--------|-------------------|  
|Evaluate predefined [!INCLUDE[nextref_adfs2](../Token/nextref_adfs2_md.md)] deployment goals that are provided in this section of the guide, and combine one or more goals to reach your organizational objectives|-   [Provide Your Active Directory Users Access to Your Claims-Aware Applications and Services](../Topic/Provide-Your-Active-Directory-Users-Access-to-Your-Claims-Aware-Applications-and-Services.md)<br />-   [Provide Your Active Directory Users Access to the Applications and Services of Other Organizations](../Topic/Provide-Your-Active-Directory-Users-Access-to-the-Applications-and-Services-of-Other-Organizations.md)<br />-   [Provide Users in Another Organization Access to Your Claims-Aware Applications and Services](../Topic/Provide-Users-in-Another-Organization-Access-to-Your-Claims-Aware-Applications-and-Services.md)|  
|Map one goal or a combination of any of the predefined [!INCLUDE[nextref_adfs2](../Token/nextref_adfs2_md.md)] deployment goals to an existing [!INCLUDE[nextref_adfs2](../Token/nextref_adfs2_md.md)] design|-   [Mapping Your Deployment Goals to an AD FS Design](../Topic/Mapping-Your-Deployment-Goals-to-an-AD-FS-Design.md)|
