# Hyper-V Replica
Hyper\-V Replica is a feature that you can use to replicate virtual machines as part of a business continuity solution. Hyper\-V Replica provides asynchronous replication of Hyper\-V virtual machines between two hosting servers. It does not require shared storage or any particular storage hardware.  
  
Before you can replicate a virtual machine, you must enable a server running Hyper\-V as a Replica server so that a server is available to receive the replicated virtual machine. To do that, modify the replication configuration settings for the server. From Hyper\-V Manager, open Hyper\-V Settings and go to the **Replication Configuration** page.  
  
After the Replica server is enabled, you can configure a virtual machine for replication.
