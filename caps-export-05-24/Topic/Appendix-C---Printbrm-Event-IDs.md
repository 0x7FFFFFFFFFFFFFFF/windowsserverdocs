# Appendix C - Printbrm Event IDs
  
## Printbrm Event IDs  
The following Printbrm events are logged in the **Applications and Services Logs\/Microsoft\/PrintBRM\/Admin** event log:  
  
|Event ID|Description|  
|------------|---------------|  
|1|Printbrm.exe \(the Printer Migration Wizard or the command\-line tool\) is beginning a backup of print queues. No user action is required.|  
|2|Printbrm.exe \(the Printer Migration Wizard or the command\-line tool\) is beginning a restore of print queues. No user action is required.|  
|3|Printbrm.exe \(the Printer Migration Wizard or the command\-line tool\) replaced driver map settings %1 with %2 for queue %3. No user action is required.|  
|4|Printer queue %1 will be restored without a separator page. Printbrm.exe \(the Printer Migration Wizard or the command\-line tool\) failed to create a separator file for this queue. Error: %2.|  
|5|Printbrm.exe \(the Printer Migration Wizard or the command\-line tool\) could not find a configuration file and is using the default settings. No user action is required.|  
|6|Printbrm.exe \(the Printer Migration Wizard or the command\-line tool\) successfully restored print queue %1. No user action is required.|  
|7|Printbrm.exe \(the Printer Migration Wizard or the command\-line tool\) restored queue %1, but failed to restore printer driver settings. Error %2. This can occur if the driver on the destination server is newer than the driver in the migration file. Open the printer Properties dialog box on the destination computer and manually specify the appropriate printer settings.|  
|8|While attempting to publish the printer to the Active Directory directory service, Printbrm.exe \(the Printer Migration Wizard or the command\-line tool\) may have failed to adjust publishing settings for %1. This can occur if Printbrm.exe cannot access Active Directory. Manually publish the printer using the printer Properties dialog box.|  
|9|Printer queue %1 already exists on the destination computer. Printbrm.exe \(the Printer Migration Wizard or the command\-line tool\) will update the printer settings to match the settings on the source computer. No user action is required.|  
|10|Printer queue %1 already exists on the destination computer and will not be changed because Printbrm.exe \(the Printer Migration Wizard or the command\-line tool\) was run in 'Keep Existing' mode. No user action is required.|  
|11|Printbrm.exe \(the Printer Migration Wizard or the command\-line tool\) failed to restore print queue %1 because port %2 is unknown. Printbrm.exe will attempt to restore the print queue on port FILE: instead. This can occur if the backup file contains incomplete data about the port, or if the port or port settings are incompatible with the version of Windows installed on the destination computer. Recreate the affected port on the destination computer and then change the print queue to use the new port.|  
|12|Printbrm.exe \(the Printer Migration Wizard or the command\-line tool\) successfully installed printer queue %1 on port FILE:. No user action is required.|  
|13|Printbrm.exe \(the Printer Migration Wizard or the command\-line tool\) failed to restore printer queue %1 on port FILE:. Error %2.
