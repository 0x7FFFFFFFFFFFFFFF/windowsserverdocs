# Delete a Site object
  You can use this procedure to delete a site object. Delete a site object only after you have removed all server objects from the site and you have reassociated the subnets with a different site. The **Servers** container is deleted when you delete the site.  
  
 Membership in **Enterprise Admins**, or equivalent, is the minimum required to complete this procedure. [!INCLUDE[review_details](../Token/review_details_md.md)]
