|2.|Determine the number of users who are likely to access, at the same time, each computer that is running [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_3](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_3_md.md)] so that you can estimate the number of required computers that must run [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_3](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_3_md.md)].|[Users, stations, and computers](../Topic/MultiPoint-Server-Site-Planning.md#BKMK_NumberofUsersStationsandComputersRunningMultiPointServer)|  
|3.|Understand the software applications and the web content that will likely be accessed by users and the impact that will have on system performance.|[Hardware Requirements and Performance Recommendations](../Topic/Hardware-Requirements-and-Performance-Recommendations.md)|

|6.|Determine where your [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_3](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_3_md.md)] system will be located. Will it be set up in a single room, or will it be set up so that it can be moved from one location to another?|[MultiPoint Server Site Planning](../Topic/MultiPoint-Server-Site-Planning.md)|  
|7.|Determine how the stations will be arranged.|[MultiPoint Server Site Planning](../Topic/MultiPoint-Server-Site-Planning.md)|  
|8.|Verify a proper power and network infrastructure.|[MultiPoint Server Site Planning](../Topic/MultiPoint-Server-Site-Planning.md)|
