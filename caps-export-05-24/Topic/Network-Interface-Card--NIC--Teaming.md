# Network Interface Card (NIC) Teaming
NIC Teaming, also known as load balancing and failover \(LBFO\), allows multiple network adapters on a computer to be placed into a team for the following purposes:  
  
-   Bandwidth aggregation  
  
-   Traffic failover to prevent connectivity loss in the event of a network component failure  
  
This feature has been a requirement for independent hardware vendors \(IHVs\) to enter the server network adapter market, but until now NIC Teaming has not been included in Windows Server operating systems.
