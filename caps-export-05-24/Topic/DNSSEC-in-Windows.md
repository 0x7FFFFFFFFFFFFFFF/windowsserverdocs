# DNSSEC in Windows
Support for Domain Name System Security Extensions \(DNSSEC\) in [!INCLUDE[win8_server_2](../Token/win8_server_2_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[winblue_server_2](../Token/winblue_server_2_md.md)] is significantly enhanced in comparison to previous versions of Windows. See the following topics for more information:  
  
-   [DNS Servers](../Topic/DNS-Servers.md): Support for DNSSEC\-signed zones on primary, authoritative DNS servers was added with [!INCLUDE[nextref_server_7](../Token/nextref_server_7_md.md)]. However, support in [!INCLUDE[nextref_server_7](../Token/nextref_server_7_md.md)] was limited to offline signing of static zones and standards such as NSEC3 and RSA\/SHA\-2 were not supported. DNSSEC support is enhanced significantly in [!INCLUDE[win8_server_2](../Token/win8_server_2_md.md)]and later operating systems.  
  
-   [DNS Clients](../Topic/DNS-Clients.md): The DNS Client service in [!INCLUDE[nextref_client_7](../Token/nextref_client_7_md.md)] and later operating systems is DNSSEC\-aware. Previous operating systems were not DNSSEC\-aware. Operating systems that are DNSSEC aware can be configured to require DNSSEC validation.  
  
-   [DNS Zones](../Topic/DNS-Zones.md): Signing a zone with DNSSEC protects it from spoofing attacks. Before you can sign a zone with DNSSEC, you must specify several DNSSEC options and parameters. You can specify zone signing parameters and sign a zone with [!INCLUDE[wps_2](../Token/wps_2_md.md)], or you can use the Zone Signing Wizard that is provided in the DNS Manager console.  
  
-   [Trust Anchors](../Topic/Trust-Anchors.md): A trust anchor is a public cryptographic key that enables a DNS server to validate DNS responses in a namespace as genuine. If a DNS server has a trust anchor, it automatically attempts to validate DNS responses for that namespace. Trust anchors must be updated each time that a zone is signed.  
  
-   [The NRPT](../Topic/The-NRPT.md): The Name Resolution Policy Table \(NRPT\) is a table of namespaces and corresponding settings that are stored in the Windows registry. The registry determines the DNS clientâ€™s behavior when issuing queries and processing responses. You can use the NRPT to configure security\-aware DNS clients to require validation of DNS responses.
