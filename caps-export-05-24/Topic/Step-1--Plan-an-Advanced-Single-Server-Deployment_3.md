# Step 1: Plan an Advanced Single Server Deployment_3
The first step in planning a [!INCLUDE[win8_server_1](../Token/win8_server_1_md.md)] Remote Access with one\-time password \(OTP\) client authentication is to plan and configure an advanced single server deployment.  
  
## Plan a single server deployment  
Before you deploy Remote Access with OTP, make sure that you have completed all the steps to deploy a single Remote Access server. See [Deploy a Single DirectAccess Server with Advanced Settings](../Topic/Deploy-a-Single-DirectAccess-Server-with-Advanced-Settings.md). Then continue to [Step 2: Plan the RADIUS Server Deployment_1](../Topic/Step-2--Plan-the-RADIUS-Server-Deployment_1.md).
