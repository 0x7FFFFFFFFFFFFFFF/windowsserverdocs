# DHCP Policy Based Assignment (PBA) Scenario Guide
This guide is intended for use by a network or systems administrator. The guide provides information about a new functionality in [!INCLUDE[win8_server_1](../Token/win8_server_1_md.md)] called policy based assignment \(PBA\) for the DHCP Server role. This guide discusses some key scenarios that are enabled by DHCP PBA.  
  
## In this guide  
The following topics are available in this guide:  
  
[Introduction to DHCP Policies](../Topic/Introduction-to-DHCP-Policies.md) discusses benefits and provides an overview of DHCP PBA.  
  
Scenarios discussed in this guide:  
  
-   [Scenario: Manage the network configuration of virtual machines](../Topic/Scenario--Manage-the-network-configuration-of-virtual-machines.md)  
  
-   [Scenario: Secure a subnet to a specific set of clients](../Topic/Scenario--Secure-a-subnet-to-a-specific-set-of-clients.md)  
  
-   [Scenario: Customize lease duration based on device type](../Topic/Scenario--Customize-lease-duration-based-on-device-type.md)  
  
For each scenario you will find a problem description with an example of conditions and settings that can be used to enable a solution. This guide is also updated periodically to incorporate new scenarios, information, and corrections.
