## Critical alerts:  
If your StorSimple appliance is running a version prior to v2.1.1.394, you need to immediately upgrade to the latest version to eliminate a risk of data loss caused by a memory leak in the NVRAM protection service. \(For more information, see [CSC\-4401 in v.2.1.1.394 of the StorSimple Release Notes](http://onlinehelp.storsimple.com/111_Appliance/4_Release_Notes/1_Current_(v2.1.1)/12_Appliance_Patch_Release_Notes_v2.1.1_(2.1.1.394-B32))\).  
  
If your StorSimple appliance is running version v2.1.1.325 or later, you can perform the upgrade as described in the [Software Patch Upgrade Guide](http://onlinehelp.storsimple.com/111_Appliance/6_System_Upgrade_Guides/Current_(v2.1.1)/0_Software_Patch_Upgrade_Guide_v2.1.1.500). If your appliance is running a version earlier than v2.1.1.325, contact Microsoft Support to upgrade your appliance.  
  
## Frequently asked questions  
Q. How do I upgrade my StorSimple appliance to the latest version of the firmware and software?  
  
A. The latest software version is 2.1.1.518, released in August 2015. The latest firmware version is 2.1.1.461. Instructions for upgrading appliance software and firmware and links to download the current upgrade packages are available at our [Online Help site](http://onlinehelp.storsimple.com/111_Appliance/6_System_Upgrade_Guides/Current_(v2.1.1)/0_Software_Patch_Upgrade_Guide_v2.1.1.518). Release notes for the 2.1.1.518 software update are available [here](http://onlinehelp.storsimple.com/111_Appliance/4_Release_Notes/1_Current_(v2.1.1)/0_Appliance_Patch_Release_Notes_v2.1.1_(2.1.1.518-B58)).  
  
-   If your appliance is currently running software \/ firmware older than version 2.1.1.325 and you wish to upgrade, please [contact technical support](https://support.microsoft.com/oas/?prid=15041&st=1&wfxredirect=1&sd=gn). Upgrading from a version prior to .325 will require assistance from the support team, since a very specific upgrade sequence must be followed to avoid the risk of system downtime.  
  
-   If your StorSimple appliance is running software version 2.1.1.325 or lower, or if it was running version 2.1.1.325 or lower when it was purchased and installed, a disk firmware update may be required. To verify whether a disk firmware update is needed or to plan and schedule an upgrade with the support team, please open a support case using [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/oas/?prid=15041&st=1&wfxredirect=1&sd=gn).
