# Reconfigure the DNS Server Service
To reconfigure the Domain Name System \(DNS\) service to account for the addition of the second domain controller in the forest root domain, complete the tasks in [Checklist: Reconfigure the DNS Server Service](../Topic/Checklist--Reconfigure-the-DNS-Server-Service.md). You can also use these procedures as you deploy additional domain controllers that are running the DNS Server service.
