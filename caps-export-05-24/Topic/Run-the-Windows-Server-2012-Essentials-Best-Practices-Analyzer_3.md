# Run the Windows Server 2012 Essentials Best Practices Analyzer_3
When you finish migrating your settings and data to [!INCLUDE[sbs_sbs8web_2](../Token/sbs_sbs8web_2_md.md)], you should run the [!INCLUDE[sbs_sbs8web_2](../Token/sbs_sbs8web_2_md.md)] Best Practices Analyzer \(BPA\) on the Destination Server.
