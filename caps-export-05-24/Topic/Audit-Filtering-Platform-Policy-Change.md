# Audit Filtering Platform Policy Change
This topic for the IT professional describes the Advanced Security Audit policy setting, **Audit Filtering Platform Policy Change**, which determines whether the operating system generates audit events for certain IPsec and Windows Filtering Platform actions.  
  
Windows Filtering Platform \(WFP\) enables independent software vendors \(ISVs\) to filter and modify TCP\/IP packets, monitor or authorize connections, filter Internet Protocol security \(IPsec\)\-protected traffic, and filter remote procedure calls \(RPCs\).  
  
This security policy setting determines whether the operating system generates audit events for:  
  
-   IPsec services status.  
  
-   Changes to IPsec settings.  
  
-   Status and changes to the Windows Filtering Platform engine and providers.  
  
-   IPsec Policy Agent service activities.  
  
Event volume: Low  
  
Default: Not configured  
  
If this policy setting is configured, the following events appear on computers running the supported versions of the Windows operating system as designated in the **Applies to** list at the beginning of this topic, in addition to Windows ServerÂ 2008 and Windows Vista.

|5460|PAStore Engine applied local registry storage IPsec policy on the computer.|  
|5461|PAStore Engine failed to apply local registry storage IPsec policy on the computer.|  
|5462|PAStore Engine failed to apply some rules of the active IPsec policy on the computer. Use the IP Security Monitor snap\-in to diagnose the problem.|

|5465|PAStore Engine received a control for forced reloading of IPsec policy and processed the control successfully.|  
|5466|PAStore Engine polled for changes to the Active Directory IPsec policy, determined that Active Directory cannot be reached, and will use the cached copy of the Active Directory IPsec policy instead. Any changes made to the Active Directory IPsec policy since the last poll could not be applied.|  
|5467|PAStore Engine polled for changes to the Active Directory IPsec policy, determined that Active Directory can be reached, and found no changes to the policy. The cached copy of the Active Directory IPsec policy is no longer being used.|
