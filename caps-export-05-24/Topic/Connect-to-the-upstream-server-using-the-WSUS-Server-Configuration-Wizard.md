# Connect to the upstream server using the WSUS Server Configuration Wizard
To continue with the WSUS server configuration, the WSUS server must connect to the upstream WSUS server.  
  
## <a name="procconnectup"></a>To connect to the upstream server  
  
1.  On the **Connect to Upstream Server** page, click **Start Connecting**. The initial connection can take several minutes.  
  
2.  After the connection has completed successfully, click **Next**.  
  
3.  If you selected to store updates locally during the WSUS server installation, the wizard proceeds to [Select update languages](assetId:///ea86ec38-ddaa-4d97-a14b-714d18063ccb#lang). If you selected to store updates on Microsoft Update, the wizard proceeds to [Select products](assetId:///ea86ec38-ddaa-4d97-a14b-714d18063ccb#products).
