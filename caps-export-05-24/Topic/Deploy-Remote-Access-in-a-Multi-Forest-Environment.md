# Deploy Remote Access in a Multi-Forest Environment
The Remote Access configuration tools \(the Remote Access Management console and the [!INCLUDE[wps_2](../Token/wps_2_md.md)] cmdlets\) are designed to work well in a single forest environment containing one or more domains. However, when Remote Access is deployed in a multi\-forest environment, the Remote Access administrator must perform some manual configuration for a successful deployment. This guide describes the planning and configuration steps for a multi\-forest deployment; including when one\-time password \(OTP\) authentication is used.
