# Deploy Folder Redirection, Offline Files, and Roaming User Profiles
This series of topics discuss how to use Windows Server to deploy Folder Redirection and Roaming User Profiles \(sometimes known as RUP\) to Windows client computers. The topics also discuss how to enable new Offline Files \(client\-side caching or CSC\) functionality included with [!INCLUDE[win8_server_2](../Token/win8_server_2_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[win8_client_2](../Token/win8_client_2_md.md)].
