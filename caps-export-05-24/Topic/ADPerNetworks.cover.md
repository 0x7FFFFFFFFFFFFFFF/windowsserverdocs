### Abstract  
 This guide contains information that you can use to determine whether Active Directory® Domain Services \(AD DS\) is appropriate for your perimeter network \(also known as DMZ or extranet\). It also contains information about the various models for deploying AD DS in perimeter networks, along with planning and deployment information for read\-only domain controllers \(RODCs\) in the perimeter network.  
  
 Because RODCs provide new capabilities for perimeter networks, most of the content in this guide describes how to plan for and deploy this new Windows Server 2008 feature. However, the other Active Directory models in this guide are also viable solutions for your perimeter network.
