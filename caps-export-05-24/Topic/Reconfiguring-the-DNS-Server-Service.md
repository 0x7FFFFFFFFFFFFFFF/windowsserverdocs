# Reconfiguring the DNS Server Service
You can reconfigure the Domain Name System \(DNS\) Server service to allow automatic cleanup and removal of stale resource records on [!INCLUDE[nextref_longhorn](../Token/nextref_longhorn_md.md)] domain controllers that run the DNS Server service. This process, called aging and scavenging, also makes it possible for you to account for the additional domain controllers in the regional domain. To reconfigure the DNS Server service to enable aging and scavenging, complete the tasks in [Checklist: Reconfiguring the DNS Server Service](../Topic/Checklist--Reconfiguring-the-DNS-Server-Service.md).
