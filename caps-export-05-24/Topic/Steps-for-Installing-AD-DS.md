# Steps for Installing AD DS
  The following sections provide step\-by\-step instructions for installing Active Directory Domain Services \(AD DS\) in all configurations, including instructions for installing it on a full installation or a Server Core installation of [!INCLUDE[nextref_longhorn](../Token/nextref_longhorn_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[nextref_server_7](../Token/nextref_server_7_md.md)]. These sections provide the Windows interface, command\-line, and answer file methods for performing installations.  
  
 The process for performing an unattended installation of AD DS is the same for a server that is running a full installation or a Server Core installation. The unattended method of installation is required for a Server Core installation.
