# Configure your desktop hosting environment
Before you start deploying any of the desktop hosting solutions for Remote Desktop Services, there are some steps you need to take to prepare your environment:  
  
- Create a [Microsoft Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).  
- Sign into the [Azure portal](http://ms.portal.azure.com).  
- Create an [Azure storage account](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/storage-create-storage-account/#create-a-storage-account).  
- Set up an [Azure virtual network](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-ds-getting-started/).  
- Create [virtual machines](Create-virtual-machines-for-Remote-Desktop.md) and [prepare them for Remote Desktop](Prepare-your-virtual-machines-for-Remote-Desktop.md).  
  
Then, after you follow the steps in the hosting guides, you'll want to [validate the connection and secure the deployment](Validate-and-secure-your-Remote-Desktop-deployment.md).
