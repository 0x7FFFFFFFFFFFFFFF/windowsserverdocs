# Where to Place a Federation Server
As a security best practice, place [!INCLUDE[firstref_adfs2](../Token/firstref_adfs2_md.md)][!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs](../Token/adfs2_fs_md.md)]s in front of a firewall and connect them to your corporate network to prevent exposure from the Internet. This is important because [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs](../Token/adfs2_fs_md.md)]s have full authorization to grant security tokens. Therefore, they should have the same protection as a domain controller. If a [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs](../Token/adfs2_fs_md.md)] is compromised, a malicious user has the ability to issue full access tokens to all Web applications and to [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs](../Token/adfs2_fs_md.md)]s that are protected by [!INCLUDE[firstref_adfs2](../Token/firstref_adfs2_md.md)] in all resource partner organizations.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> As a security best practice, avoid having your [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs](../Token/adfs2_fs_md.md)]s directly accessible on the Internet. Consider giving your [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs](../Token/adfs2_fs_md.md)]s direct Internet access only when you are setting up a test lab environment or when your organization does not have a perimeter network.  
  
For typical corporate networks, an intranet\-facing firewall is established between the corporate network and the perimeter network, and an Internet\-facing firewall is often established between the perimeter network and the Internet. In this situation, the [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs](../Token/adfs2_fs_md.md)] sits inside the corporate network, and it is not directly accessible by Internet clients.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Client computers that are connected to the corporate network can communicate directly with the [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs](../Token/adfs2_fs_md.md)] through Windows Integrated Authentication.  
  
A [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fsp](../Token/adfs2_fsp_md.md)] should be placed in the perimeter network before you configure your firewall servers for use with [!INCLUDE[nextref_adfs2](../Token/nextref_adfs2_md.md)]. For more information, see [Where to Place a Federation Server Proxy](../Topic/Where-to-Place-a-Federation-Server-Proxy.md).  
  
## Configuring your firewall servers for a federation server  
So that the [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs](../Token/adfs2_fs_md.md)]s can communicate directly with [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs](../Token/adfs2_fs_md.md)] proxies, the intranet firewall server must be configured to allow Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol \(HTTPS\) traffic from the [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fsp](../Token/adfs2_fsp_md.md)] to the [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs](../Token/adfs2_fs_md.md)]. This is a requirement because the intranet firewall server must publish the [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs](../Token/adfs2_fs_md.md)] using portÂ 443 so that the [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fsp](../Token/adfs2_fsp_md.md)] in the perimeter network can access the [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs](../Token/adfs2_fs_md.md)].  
  
In addition, the intranet\-facing firewall server, such as a server running Internet Security and Acceleration \(ISA\) Server, uses a process known as server publishing to distribute Internet client requests to the appropriate corporate [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs](../Token/adfs2_fs_md.md)]s. This means that you must manually create a server publishing rule on the intranet server running ISA Server that publishes the clustered [!INCLUDE[adfs2_fs](../Token/adfs2_fs_md.md)] URL, for example, http:\/\/fs.fabrikam.com.  
  
For more information about how to configure server publishing in a perimeter network, see [Where to Place a Federation Server Proxy](../Topic/Where-to-Place-a-Federation-Server-Proxy.md). For information about how to configure ISA Server to publish a server, see Create a secure Web publishing rule \([http:\/\/go.microsoft.com\/fwlink\/?LinkId\=75182](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=75182)\).
