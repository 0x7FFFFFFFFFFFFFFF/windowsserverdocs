# Managing Domain and Forest Trusts
  It is necessary to manage domain and forest trusts when your organization needs to collaborate with users or resources that are located in other domains, realms, or forests in your organization and in other organizations. To set up an environment that takes advantage of trusts, you must first create and configure the appropriate trusts that will make it possible for your organization to communicate effectively with users or resources in other locations.
