# Enable Processor Compatability Mode
Enabling processor compatibility modeHyper\-V offers a feature called processor compatibility mode, which was first introduced in Windows Server 2008 R2. Processor compatibility mode allows you to move a running virtual machineÂ or save state between virtualization hosts that use different generations of processors.  
  
1.  Click **Start**, point to **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Hyper\-V Manager**.  
  
2.  Select the server running Hyper\-V and the desired virtual machine.  
  
3.  If the virtual machine is running, you must shut down the virtual machine to change the processor compatibility mode setting.  
  
4.  In the Action pane, click **Settings**, and then click **Processor**.
