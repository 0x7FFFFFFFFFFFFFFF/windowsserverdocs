# View and Change the Display Size of Desktop Images in MultiPoint Dashboard
An easy way to monitor user activities on individual desktops is to view thumbnail images of each active desktop on your MultiPoint Services system. By default, images of desktops are displayed in [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_dashboard](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_dashboard_md.md)] on the **Home** tab.  
  
Using [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_dashboard](../Token/win8_server_multipoint_dashboard_md.md)], you can do the following:  
  
1.  View a user’s desktop more closely by enlarging its view in the dashboard.  
  
2.  Change the size of the thumbnail images that are displayed in the dashboard. Three sizes are available for view: small, medium, or large. Medium is the default setting.  
  
3.  View all desktops on the MultiPoint Services system, or choose a filtered view that shows active desktops.
