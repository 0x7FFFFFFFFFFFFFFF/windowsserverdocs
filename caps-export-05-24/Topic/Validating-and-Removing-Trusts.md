# Validating and Removing Trusts
  After a trust has been established, you might need to verify that it is working as designed—or that communications over the trust are working—by using Active Directory Domain Services \(AD DS\) tools to validate connectivity over the trust. It might also be necessary to remove an existing, manually created trust when connectivity between two domains is no longer necessary.  
  
 **Task requirements**  
  
 You can use either of the following tools to perform the procedures for this task:  
  
-   Active Directory Domains and Trusts  
  
-   Netdom.exe  
  
 For more information about how to use the Netdom command\-line tool to validate and remove trusts, see Netdom Overview \([http:\/\/go.microsoft.com\/fwlink\/?LinkId\=111537](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=111537)\).  
  
 To complete this task, perform the following procedures:  
  
-   [Validate a Trust](../Topic/Validate-a-Trust.md)  
  
-   [Remove a Manually Created Trust](../Topic/Remove-a-Manually-Created-Trust.md)
