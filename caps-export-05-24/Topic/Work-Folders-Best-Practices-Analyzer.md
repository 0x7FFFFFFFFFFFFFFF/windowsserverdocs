# Work Folders Best Practices Analyzer
Topics in this section can help you bring Work Folders running on [!INCLUDE[winblue_server_2](../Token/winblue_server_2_md.md)] into compliance with best practices. Content in this section is most valuable to administrators who have completed a Best Practices Analyzer scan of File and Storage Services, and who want information about how to interpret and resolve the scan results that identify areas of Work Folders that are noncompliant with best practices.  
  
For more information about Best Practices Analyzer and scans, see [Run Best Practices Analyzer Scans and Manage Scan Results_1](../Topic/Run-Best-Practices-Analyzer-Scans-and-Manage-Scan-Results_1.md).
