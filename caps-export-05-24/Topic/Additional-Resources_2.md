    This TechNet page contains links to documentation about the most common uses for IPsec: server isolation and domain isolation.  
  
## Group Policy  
Group Policy is a key method for implementing firewall and server and domain isolation designs.  
  
For more information about Group Policy and related technologies, see:

-   [HOWTO: Leverage Group Policies with WMI Filters](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/555253) \(http:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/kb\/555253\)  
  
    This article describes how to create a WMI filter to set the scope of a GPO based on computer attributes, such as operating system.  
  
## Active Directory Domain Services  
Organizations can use AD DS to manage users and resources, such as computers, printers, or applications, on a network. Server isolation and domain isolation also require AD DS to use the Kerberos V5 protocol for IPsec authentication.  
  
For more information about AD DS and related technologies, see:
