Determine a suitable distributed network name (DNN) for the HGS cluster. 
This name will be registered in the HGS DNS service to make it easy to contact any node in the HGS cluster. 
As an example, if you have 3 HGS nodes with hostnames HGS01, HGS02, and HGS03, you might decide to choose "HGS" or "HgsCluster" for the DNN. 
Do not provide a fully qualified domain name to the `Initialize-HgsServer` cmdlet (use "hgs" not "hgs.relecloud.com").
