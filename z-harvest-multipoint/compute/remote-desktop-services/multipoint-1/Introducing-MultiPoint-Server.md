# Introducing MultiPoint Services
MultiPoint Services role in Windows Server 2016 allows multiple users, each with their own independent and familiar Windows experience, to simultaneously share one computer.There are several ways users can access their sessions. One way is by remoting into the server using the remote desktop apps with any device. Another way is through physical stations that stations attached to the MultiPoint server:

-   Directly to video ports on the computer  
  
-   Through specialized USB zero clients \(also referred to as multifunction USB hubs\), as well as through similar USB\-over\-Ethernet devices.  
  
-   Over the local area network \(LAN\)  
  
Each of these methods is described in more detail in [MultiPoint Server Stations](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/MultiPoint-Server-Stations.md) later in this document.  
  
This document addresses the following factors to consider when you are planning to deploy MultiPoint Services:  
  
-   What type of desktops to use with your MultiPoint Services system: Will you need sessions, virtual machines, or Windows PCs?  
  
-   [Selecting Hardware for Your MultiPoint Server System](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/Selecting-Hardware-for-Your-MultiPoint-Server-System.md): What hardware decisions should you make?  
  
-   [Hardware Requirements and Performance Recommendations](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/Hardware-Requirements-and-Performance-Recommendations.md): What hardware is required for MultiPoint Services?  
  
-   [MultiPoint Server Site Planning](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/MultiPoint-Server-Site-Planning.md): Where will the computers that are running MultiPoint Services and their stations be located, and how will they be configured?  
  
-   [Network Considerations and User Accounts](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/Network-Considerations-and-User-Accounts.md): The networking environment into which the MultiPoint Services system is deployed can affect how user accounts are managed. What is your networking environment? How will user accounts be managed?  
  
-   [Storing Files with MultiPoint Services](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/Storing-Files-with-MultiPoint-Server.md): Where will user files be stored, and how will they be accessed?  
  
-   [Predeployment Checklist](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/Predeployment-Checklist.md)
