# Configure stations for automatic logon
If you want your stations to be available to anyone – and your users do not need private folders to store their personal data or personalized desktops – you can configure the stations for automatic logon. Auto\-logon automatically logs on a user account that has been specified in the auto\-logon settings when the MultiPoint Server starts.  
  
### To configure a station for automatic log\-on  
  
1.  From the **Start** screen, open **MultiPoint Manager**.  
  
2.  Click the **Stations** tab, and then click the name of the station that you want to configure for auto\-logon.  
  
3.  In the right pane, click **Configure auto\-logon**.  
  
    The Configure Auto\-Logon page opens.  
  
4.  Select the **Auto\-logon using the following information** check box, and then enter the user account and password to use for auto\-logon. Click **OK**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > The user account that you use for auto\-logon must have a password.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> To temporarily log on to a station that is set up for automatic logon with a different user account, hover over the top right corner of the screen to display a vertical menu, click the Settings charm, click the Power icon, and then hold the SHIFT key and click **Disconnect**. Hold down the SHIFT key until a logon prompt appears.
