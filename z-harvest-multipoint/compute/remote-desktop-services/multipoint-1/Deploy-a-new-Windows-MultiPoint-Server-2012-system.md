# Deploy a new Windows MultiPoint Server 2012 system
The topics in this section explain how to set up your [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_2](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/includes/win8_server_multipoint_2_md.md)] computer and stations. You will install and configure MultiPoint Server; set up your stations; install drivers, updates, and software; optionally join a domain; activate MultiPoint Server; and add client access licenses \(CALs\) for each station.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you have not yet planned your [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_2](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/includes/win8_server_multipoint_2_md.md)] deployment, see [Planning a Windows MultiPoint Server 2010 Deployment](assetId:///eba1666c-4228-4dc4-a0fb-e51f4b5a8e22) \(http:\/\/technet.microsoft.com\/library\/jj916408.aspx\).
