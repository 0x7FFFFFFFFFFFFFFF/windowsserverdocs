# Predeployment Checklist
Use the following checklist to help you plan your MultiPoint Services deployment.  
  
|Step|Issue|Help Topic|  
|--------|---------|--------------|  
|1.|Verify that your applications are compatible with MultiPoint Services.|[Application Considerations](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/Application-Considerations.md)|  
|2.|Determine the number of users who are likely to access, at the same time, each computer that is running MultiPoint Services so that you can estimate the number of required computers that must run MultiPoint Services.|[Users, stations, and computers](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/MultiPoint-Server-Site-Planning.md#BKMK_NumberofUsersStationsandComputersRunningMultiPointServer)|  
|3.|Understand the software applications and the web content that will likely be accessed by users and the impact that will have on system performance.|[Hardware Requirements and Performance Recommendations](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/Hardware-Requirements-and-Performance-Recommendations.md)|  
|4.|Determine the number and type of stations that will be connected to the system.|[MultiPoint Stations](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/MultiPoint-Server-Stations.md)|  
|5.|Determine the hardware that is needed.|[Selecting Hardware for Your MultiPoint Services System](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/Selecting-Hardware-for-Your-MultiPoint-Server-System.md) and [Hardware Requirements and Performance Recommendations](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/Hardware-Requirements-and-Performance-Recommendations.md)|  
|6.|Determine where your MultiPoint Services system will be located. Will it be set up in a single room, or will it be set up so that it can be moved from one location to another?|[MultiPoint Server Site Planning](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/MultiPoint-Server-Site-Planning.md)|  
|7.|Determine how the stations will be arranged.|[MultiPoint Services Site Planning](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/MultiPoint-Server-Site-Planning.md)|  
|8.|Verify a proper power and network infrastructure.|[MultiPoint Services Site Planning](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/MultiPoint-Server-Site-Planning.md)|  
|9.|Determine how user accounts will be implemented and managed.|[Network Considerations and User Accounts](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/Network-Considerations-and-User-Accounts.md)|  
|10.|Determine how user files will be shared and stored.|[Storing Files with MultiPoint Services](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/Storing-Files-with-MultiPoint-Server.md)|
