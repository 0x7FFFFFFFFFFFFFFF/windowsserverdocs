# Allow one account to have multiple sessions
To enable a group of users use a shared account on multiple stations at the same time, configure the MultiPoint server to allow one account to be logged on to multiple stations simultaneously. By default, if a user logs on to a second station with a shared user account, the user account is logged off the first station.  
  
### To configure the server to allow multiple session per account  
  
1.  From the **Start** screen, open **MultiPoint Manager**.  
  
2.  Click the **Home** tab.  
  
3.  In the **Computer** column, click the name of the MultiPoint Server computer, and then, in the right pane, click **Edit server settings**.  
  
4.  Select the **Allow one account to have multiple sessions** check box, and then click **OK**.
