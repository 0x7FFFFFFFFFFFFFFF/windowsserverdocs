# Collect hardware and device drivers needed for the installation
Before you start your MultiPoint Server 2012 system installation, you will need:  
  
-   **Hardware components for the server** \- Install any additional video cards or other system components at this time.  
  
-   **Hardware components for the stations** \- For information about planning stations for your environment, see [Selecting Hardware for Your MultiPoint Server System](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/JJ916407(l=en-us,v=Technet.10).aspx).  
  
-   **The latest drivers for your video cards** \- If your OEM or device manufacturer did not supply these, you will need to download them from the device manufacturer’s website.  
  
-   **The latest USB zero client drivers** \- If you are using USB zero client stations, you must install the latest USB zero client drivers.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > For a MultiPoint Server installation, you must install the 64\-bit version of these and other drivers.  
  
> [!TIP]  
> If you are installing Windows MultiPoint Server on a computer with a different version of Windows already installed, you should find out the video card make and model in Device Manager before you start the MultiPoint Server installation. To open Device Manager, open **Computer Management** from the **Start** screen. Then, in the console tree, click **Device Manager**.
