# How to Buy MultiPoint Server
This topic explores the available versions of [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_3](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/includes/win8_server_multipoint_3_md.md)] and explains how you can purchase them. For more information, see [How to Try and Buy](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/multipoint/buy.aspx) on the [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_3](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/includes/win8_server_multipoint_3_md.md)] website.  
  
## Evaluation version  
For a free downloadable version that you can evaluate, see [Windows MultiPoint Server 2012 Evaluation](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=35821) in the Microsoft Download Center. This evaluation version is good for 180 days, and can be converted to the full product if you decide to purchase and download product keys to activate it.  
  
## Volume License version  
If you already have the hardware that you want to use for your [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_3](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/includes/win8_server_multipoint_3_md.md)] setup, you can buy [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_3](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/includes/win8_server_multipoint_3_md.md)] through the Microsoft Volume Licensing Service Center. For this, you need to determine if you are an academic user or a commercial user.  For more information about purchasing the appropriate license, see the following sites:  
  
-   [Volume Licenses for Academic Organizations](http://www.microsoft.com/education/ww/buy/Pages/BuyLicense.aspx)  
  
-   [Licensing Options for Small and Midsize Organizations](http://www.microsoft.com/licensing/licensing-options/open-license.aspx)  
  
## OEM version  
You can purchase [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_3](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/includes/win8_server_multipoint_3_md.md)] from a Microsoft original equipment manufacturer \(OEM\) partner. This is the easiest way to obtain a complete solution. You can purchase a host computer with the [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_3](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/includes/win8_server_multipoint_3_md.md)] software installed, as well as station devices. For more information, see the [Worldwide OEM Partners](http://www.microsoft.com/OEM/en/products/Pages/index.aspx#fbid=U8dWtKSkArR) site.  
  
## Client access licenses  
All [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_3](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/includes/win8_server_multipoint_3_md.md)] stations require client access licenses \(CALs\).  
  
### For volume license versions  
Commonly in customer environments that are running Windows Server® 2008 or Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008 CALs are already purchased. To prevent buying the same CAL twice, Microsoft has provided two licensing options for the Windows MultiPoint Server 2012 CAL. One option includes the Windows Server 2008 CAL, and the other option excludes it to recognize an existing CAL ownership.  
  
### For OEM versions  
If you purchase an OEM version, each station requires a Windows MultiPoint Server CAL, which is available from your OEM.
