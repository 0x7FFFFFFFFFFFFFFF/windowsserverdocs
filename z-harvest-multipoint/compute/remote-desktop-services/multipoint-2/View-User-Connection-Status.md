# View User Connection Status
Use the **Stations** tab to determine the status of a *standard* or other *administrative user’s* connection to a MultiPoint Services *station*.  
  
Status values include the following:  
  
-   **Logged on**: A user session that is active on a station  
  
-   **Suspended**: A user session that is suspended, but is still active on the computer. The user’s desktop session is preserved until the user logs on again  
  
-   **Logged off**: A user who is logged off is not displayed on the **Stations** tab  
  
#### To view station status  
  
-   In [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_manager](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/includes/win8_server_multipoint_manager_md.md)], in station mode, click the **Stations** tab.
