# Block or Unblock a Station
You can block a user or users from the MultiPoint Services system if you need to get their attention. While users are blocked, their sessions remains active in the MultiPoint Services system’s computer memory until the stations are unblocked. You can customize a message to be displayed for a blocked user.  
  
#### To block a station  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_dashboard](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/includes/win8_server_multipoint_dashboard_md.md)], select the thumbnail image of the station you want to block.  
  
2.  On the Blocking tab, click **Block**, and then click **Block Selected Desktop\(s\)**.  
  
#### To block all stations  
  
In [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_dashboard](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/includes/win8_server_multipoint_dashboard_md.md)], on the Blocking tab, click **Block**, and then click **Block All Desktops**.  
  
#### To unblock a station  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_dashboard](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/includes/win8_server_multipoint_dashboard_md.md)], select the thumbnail image of the station you want to unblock.  
  
2.  On the Blocking tab, click **Unblock**, and then click **Unblock Selected Desktop\(s\)**.  
  
#### To unblock all stations  
  
In [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_dashboard](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/includes/win8_server_multipoint_dashboard_md.md)], on the Blocking tab, click **Unblock**, and then click **Unblock All Desktops**.  
  
## Create a message to display for blocked users  
Before you block a user, you may want to create a message to display on the user’s monitor when they are blocked. For example, “Please turn your attention to the speaker.” **Station blocked** is the default text if you do not create your own message.  
  
#### To create a message to display for blocked users  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[win8_server_multipoint_dashboard](../../../compute/remote-desktop-services/multipoint-1/includes/win8_server_multipoint_dashboard_md.md)], click the **Home** tab.  
  
2.  Click the **Block** drop\-down menu, and then click **Set Message**. The **Set Message for Blocked Users** page opens.  
  
3.  Type the message you want to display on the blocked station\(s\), and then click **OK**.
