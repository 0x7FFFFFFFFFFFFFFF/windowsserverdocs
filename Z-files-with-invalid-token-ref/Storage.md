# Storage
This collection contains detailed information about storage products and features for the IT professional to design, deploy, and maintain Windows Server. Following are the storage technologies and documentation for [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_2](includes/winthreshold_server_2_md.md)].

> [!NOTE] To download [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_2](includes/winthreshold_server_2_md.md)], see [Windows Server Evaluations](http://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-technical-preview).

|Topic Title|Description|
|-|-|
|[What's New in File and Storage Services](What-s-New-in-File-and-Storage-Services-in-Windows-Server-2016-Technical-Preview.md)|Discover new storage technologies and new features for existing technologies in [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_2](includes/winthreshold_server_2_md.md)]|
|[What's New in Failover Clustering](What-s-New-in-Failover-Clustering-in-Windows-Server-Technical-Preview.md)|Discover whatâ€™s new in clustering in [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_2](includes/winthreshold_server_2_md.md)]|
|[Storage Spaces Direct in Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview](Storage-Spaces-Direct-in-Windows-Server-2016-Technical-Preview.md)|Storage Spaces Direct is a new feature in [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_2](includes/winthreshold_server_2_md.md)] that enables building highly available (HA) storage systems with local storage which is either disk devices that are internal to each storage node, or disk devices in JBODs where each JBOD is only connected to a single storage node.|
|[Hyper-converged Solution using Storage Spaces Direct](Storage-Spaces-Direct-in-Windows-Server-2016-Technical-Preview.md)| Build a hyper-converged solution using Storage Spaces Direct with [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_2](includes/winthreshold_server_2_md.md)] Nano Server.|
|[Storage Replica in Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview](Storage-Replica-in-Windows-Server-2016-Technical-Preview.md)|Storage Replica is a new feature in [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_2](includes/winthreshold_server_2_md.md)] that enables storage-agnostic, block-level, synchronous replication between clusters or servers for disaster recovery, as well as stretching of a failover cluster for high availability.|
|[Storage Quality of Service](Storage-Quality-of-Service.md)|Storage Quality of Service (Storage QoS) is a new feature in [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_2](includes/winthreshold_server_2_md.md)] that provides a way to centrally monitor and manage storage performance for virtual machines using Hyper-V and the Scale-Out File Server roles. The feature automatically improves storage resource fairness between multiple virtual machines using the same file server cluster and allows specific minimum and maximum performance goals to be configured in units of normalized IOPs.|
|[Cluster Operating System Rolling Upgrade](Cluster-Operating-System-Rolling-Upgrade.md)|Cluster Operating System Rolling Upgrade is a new feature in [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_2](includes/winthreshold_server_2_md.md)] that enables an administrator to upgrade the operating system of the cluster nodes from [!INCLUDE[winblue_server_2](includes/winblue_server_2_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_2](includes/winthreshold_server_2_md.md)] without stopping the Hyper-V or the Scale-Out File Server workloads. Using this feature, the downtime penalties against Service Level Agreements (SLA) can be avoided.|
|[Health Service](Health-Service-in-Windows-Server-2016.md)| Health Service is a new feature in [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_2](includes/winthreshold_server_2_md.md)] that which significantly improves the day-to-day monitoring, operations, and maintenance experience of Storage Spaces.|
|[Fault Domains](Fault-Domains-in-Windows-Server-2016-Technical-Preview.md)|Fault Domains is a new feature in [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_2](includes/winthreshold_server_2_md.md)]. This topic provides an overview of fault domains and describes how to configure them. |
|[Simplified SMB Multichannel and Multi-NIC Cluster Networks](Simplified-SMB-Multichannel-and-Multi-NIC-Cluster-Networks.md)|Simplified SMB Multichannel and Multi-NIC Cluster Networks is a new feature in [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_2](includes/winthreshold_server_2_md.md)] that enables the use of multiple NICs on the same cluster network subnet, and automatically enables SMB Mutichannel. workloads. Using this feature, the downtime penalties against Service Level Agreements (SLA) can be avoided.|
