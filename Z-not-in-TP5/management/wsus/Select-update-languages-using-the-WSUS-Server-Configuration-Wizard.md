# Select update languages using the WSUS Server Configuration Wizard
If you store updates on the local WSUS server, you must select the languages in which the updates are downloaded. These options are presented on the **Choose Languages** page of the WSUS server configuration wizard.

You should always select English regardless of the other languages that you need. All updates are based on English language packs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Language options can be different for upstream WSUS servers than for downstream WSUS servers. You should understand how language options work and plan their implementation to conserve resources and to guarantee that updates are always downloaded in all the needed languages.
> 
> For complete information and recommendations about update language options, see [Plan for WSUS language updates](assetId:///358e5660-ce8a-483a-aa60-e74fcee7b19c) in this deployment guide.
