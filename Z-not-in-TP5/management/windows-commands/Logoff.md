# Logoff
Logs off a user from a session on a Remote Desktop Session Host (RD Session Host) server and deletes the session from the server.

For examples of how to use this command, see [Examples](#BKMK_examples).

> [!NOTE]
> In Windows Server 2008 R2, Terminal Services was renamed Remote Desktop Services. To find out what's new in the latest version, see [Whatâ€™s New in Remote Desktop Services in Windows Server 2012](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh831527) in the Windows Server TechNet Library.

## Syntax

```
logoff [<SessionName> | <SessionID>] [/server:<ServerName>] [/v]
```

## Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|-------------|---------------|
|<SessionName>|Specifies the name of the session.|
|<SessionID>|Specifies the numeric ID which identifies the session to the server.|
|/server:<ServerName>|Specifies the RD Session Host server that contains the session whose user you want to log off. If unspecified, the server on which you are currently active is used.|
|/v|Displays information about the actions being performed.|
|/?|Displays help at the command prompt.|

## Remarks

-   You can always log off from the session to which you are currently logged on. You must, however, have Full Control permission to log off users from other sessions.

-   Logging off a user from a session without warning can result in loss of data at the user's session. You should send a message to the user by using the **msg** command to warn the user before taking this action.

-   If <*SessionID*> or <*SessionName*> is not specified, **logoff** logs off the user from the current session. If you specify <*SessionName*>, it must be an active one.

-   When you log off a user, all processes end and the session is deleted from the server.

-   You cannot log off a user from the console session.

## <a name="BKMK_examples"></a>Examples

-   To log off a user from the current session, type:

    ```
    logoff
    ```

-   To log off a user from a session by using the session's ID, for example session 12, type:

    ```
    logoff 12
    ```

-   To log off a user from a session by using the name of the session and server, for example session TERM04 on Server1, type:

    ```
    logoff TERM04 /server:Server1
    ```
